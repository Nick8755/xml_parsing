39683742,A New Demand for Improved Selectivity and Potency of Cyanine Dyes as Antiproliferative Agents Against Colorectal Cancer Cells.,"Cancer treatment remains a significant challenge, with chemotherapy still being one of the most common therapeutic approaches. Based on our initial studies of symmetric monomethine cyanine dyes, which showed potential against colorectal cancer, this study explored several asymmetric cyanines, aiming to develop more potent and selective antitumor agents, particularly against colorectal cancer. In pursuit of this goal, we have designed, synthesized, and structurally characterized twelve new cyanine dyes. Their antiproliferative effects were then investigated in vitro against both tumor and non-tumor cell lines. Notably, the two most promising dyes in terms of potency and selectivity against Caco-2 colorectal cancer cells were derived from the combination of <i>N</i>-methylbenzoxazole and <i>N</i>-methylquinoline (dye <b>5</b>), as well as <i>N</i>-ethylbenzothiazole and <i>N</i>-ethyl-6-nitrobenzothiazole (dye <b>10</b>). The potential mechanisms behind their antiproliferative action were also explored, revealing that both dyes penetrate cells and localize within the cytoplasm and nucleus. Furthermore, dye <b>5</b> was found to slightly induce apoptosis without causing significant cell cycle arrest, in contrast to dye <b>10</b>, which increased the number of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Interestingly, both dyes exhibited marked topoisomerase II inhibitory effects, particularly cyanine <b>5</b>, which may further explain their antiproliferative activity. Additionally, drug-likeness properties were predicted for both dyes. Overall, cyanine <b>5</b> emerged as the most promising candidate for further investigation as a potential treatment for colorectal cancer.",,,"Humans, Colorectal Neoplasms, Cell Proliferation, Carbocyanines, Antineoplastic Agents, Apoptosis, Caco-2 Cells, Cell Line, Tumor, Coloring Agents, DNA Topoisomerases, Type II, Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor, Structure-Activity Relationship, Molecular Structure, Topoisomerase II Inhibitors",,
39671995,Visual and real-time detection of the critical micelle concentration of nonionic surfactants using a supramolecular aggregate probe responsive to stable micelles.,"The critical micelle concentration (CMC) is considered one of the important parameters for evaluating and comparing surfactants. We have developed a novel method for detecting the CMC of nonionic surfactants, based on the environmentally responsive characteristics of cyanine dyes probes. Notably, this method exhibits high sensitivity, visual real-time monitoring capabilities, and robust anti-interference properties. The method remains effective even under alterations in pH (2-12), metal ion concentrations (0-150 mM of K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and salinity levels (0-20 g/L). Furthermore, the method has been successfully applied to the analysis of real water such as lake water, water flooding, and oil-field sewage containing polymers, demonstrating its good applicability. This marks the first instance where we establish the application of detecting the CMC of nonionic surfactants using cyanine dye probes, offering a fresh perspective for developing highly sensitive, visual, real-time, and interference-resistant CMC detection methodologies.",,,,,
39643290,Conjugated polymer-boosted near-infrared electrochemiluminescence of organic dye for detecting acetamiprid.,"The near-infrared electrochemiluminescence (NIR-ECL) has excellent penetration and near zero background interference, and has shown unique advantages in clinical medicine and bioimaging. Among various types of NIR-ECL emitters, NIR organic dyes have arouse the concern of researchers due to their adjustable structure and diverse optical properties. However, the currently available NIR dyes usually have inherent self-quenching effect and poor photostability, so their ECL efficiency is low, and it is a great challenge to improve their ECL performance. Conjugated polymer-boosted NIR-ECL strategy was creatively developed to overcome ECL performance limitations of NIR dyes. IR 783, as one of heptamethine cyanine dyes, was performed a nanoprecipitation in the presence of poly[(9,9-dlhexyfluoren-2,7-dlyl)-co-(anthracen-9,10-dlyl)] (PFAD) to prepare IR polymer nanoparticles (IR PNPs). Due to resonance energy transfer (RET) from PFAD to IR 783 and encapsulation of IR 783 by PFAD, the resulting IR PNPs exhibited a strong and stable NIR-ECL emission with a maximum ECL wavelength of 802 nm under coreactant tripropylamine (TPrA) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> can effectively quench it. IR PNPs coupled proximity ligation assay (PLA)-induced DNA walker to achieve acetamiprid (ACE) analysis. ACE triggered PLA to form bipedal DNA walker, and further release G-rich secondary target (ST). With ST and hemin being captured on IR PNPs modified electrode, hemin/G-quadruplex was assembled to consume H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, thereby restoring ECL signal for ACE detection with a limit of detection of 4.74 × 10<sup>-15</sup> M. This work opens up a new and simple way to boost NIR-ECL of organic dyes, and IR PNPs create a promising NIR-ECL platform for pesticide detection.",,,"Polymers, Electrochemical Techniques, Neonicotinoids, Luminescent Measurements, Infrared Rays, Fluorescent Dyes, Limit of Detection, Coloring Agents",,
39642627,Fluorescence enhancement of cyanine/hemicyanine dyes with adamantane as an auxochrome through host-guest inclusion with methylated cyclodextrin in water.,"Fluorescence of cyanine dyes is often quenched in aqueous solution, limiting their application in water or biological system. In this work, a novel strategy of host-guest interaction based on cyanine derivatives containing auxochromes was proposed to enhance fluorescence in aqueous solution and cell imaging. By using the host (methylated β-cyclodextrin, M-β-CD) to inclusion and suppress the TICT effect of the dye, the fluorescence was significantly enhanced at lower host concentration. Cyanine and hemicyanine dyes (Ad-NH-1a, Ad-NH-1b and Ad-NH-2) with adamantyl group as auxochrome were designed and prepared by using host-guest complexation to inhibit the TICT effect of dyes, thus realizing the purpose of significantly enhancing the fluorescence of dyes at lower concentration. After adding M-β-CD, the fluorescence quantum yields of these dyes increased to 15.9 %, 21.8 %, and 6.08 %, respectively. In comparison, the fluorescence quantum yield of the dyes Ad-CONH-1 and Ad-CONH-2 containing adamantyl groups, increased only modestly from 1.78 to 2.83 times. Encouraged by these satisfactory results, further cell experiments were conducted with Ad-NH-1a, Ad-NH-1b, and Ad-NH-2. The experiment showed that adding a lower concentration of M-β-CD significantly reduced the clear imaging dosage of the probe (0.3 μM) without altering the organelle targeting of the probes.",,,,,
39607701,Self-Assembly of a Perfluorinated Amphiphilic Cyanine Dye into Branched Tubular J-Aggregates.,"The self-assembly process is governed by the individual constituents of molecules through precise non-covalent interactions. Amphiphilic cyanines are intriguing in supramolecular chemistry due to the large polarizability of their delocalized π-electron systems, their tuneable optical properties and their ability to form well-defined self-assembled structures in different media. Here we present the synthesis of a novel tetrahydroxy amphiphilic carbocyanine dye with perfluoro alkylated chains -(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-(CF<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>-CF<sub>3</sub> as hydrophobic segments and aminoproanediol as hydrophilic segment. The target molecule was synthesized in a multi-step process, which illustrates the complexity and precision required to achieve the desired structure. This study focuses on the comparison of the influence of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>17</sub> and C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>4</sub>F<sub>13</sub> tails and the effects of carboxylated and non-ionic aminopropanediol head groups as substituents on self-assembly of the TBC dye. Absorption and fluorescence measurements show similar spectroscopic properties to cyanine dyes studied previously. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) reveals formation of multiple supramolecular aggregates. As supramolecular assembly is very sensitive to sample preparation, multilamellar or multivesicular vesicles are obtained preferentially in vigorously vortexed solutions. Moreover, time-dependent tube formation was observed in gently mixed solutions. Thereby, we could follow the growing mechanism of the unprecedented Y-junctions of supramolecular tubes.",,,,,
39589839,Deep-Red and Near-Infrared Compact Cyanine Dyes for Sensitive NAD(P)H Sensing in Live Cells and Kidney Disease Tissues.,"Cyanine dyes constructed for NAD(P)H near-infrared sensing utilize extended π-conjugation but often exhibit delayed fluorescence responses to NAD(P)H due to reduced positive charge density in 3-quinolinium acceptors. This study introduces deep-red and near-infrared compact cyanine dyes represented by probes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> for mitochondrial NAD(P)H detection in live cells. Probes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> feature a unique structural design with a double bond connection linking 3-quinolinium to strategically positioned 1-methylquinolinium acceptor units at 2- and 4-positions, correspondingly. Probe <b>A</b> absorbs at 359 and 531 nm, while probe <b>B</b> absorbs at 324 and 370 nm, emitting subtle fluorescence at 587 and 628 nm, respectively, with no NADH present. Upon NADH exposure, probes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> exhibit significant emission enhancements at 612 and 656 nm, correspondingly, attributed to the efficient reduction of 3-quinolinium units to electron-donative 1-methyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline units. Probe <b>B</b>, chosen for its near-infrared emission and fast response to NAD(P)H, effectively monitored dynamic intracellular NAD(P)H levels throughout diverse experimental conditions. In HeLa cells, minimal basal fluorescence increased upon NADH stimulation. It also identified increased NAD(P)H levels following chemical treatments with acesulfame potassium, cisplatin, carboplatin, and temozolomide, CoCl<sub>2</sub>-induced hypoxia, and TLR4 activation in macrophages and in disease models of kidney pathology, where diseased tissues exhibited higher fluorescence than normal tissues. In fruit fly larvae under starvation conditions, probe <b>B</b> tracked NAD(P)H increases triggered by exogenous NADH, demonstrating its in vivo applicability for metabolic studies. These findings highlight probe <b>B</b>'s utility in elucidating dynamic NAD(P)H fluctuations in diverse biological contexts, offering insights into mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism.",,,"Humans, Fluorescent Dyes, Animals, Carbocyanines, Molecular Structure, Kidney Diseases, Biocompatible Materials, Mice, Materials Testing, NADP, NAD, Optical Imaging",,
39576179,Design strategies and applications of cyanine dyes in phototherapy.,"Cyanine dyes have been widely used in phototherapy in recent years due to their excellent optical properties and diverse modifiable structures. This review provides detailed descriptions of the basic structures of various cyanines and their derivatives as well as their optical properties. It summarizes the strategies for constructing cyanine dyes for phototherapy and discusses their structure-effect relationship. Furthermore, a comprehensive classification and summary of the applications of cyanine dyes in phototherapy are presented. Importantly, this review also addresses both the advances made in this field as well as the challenges that need to be overcome. We hope that these profound insights into phototherapy using cyanine dyes will facilitate the design of future systems for clinical applications based on these compounds.",,,,,
39535644,"Benzo[c,d]Indole-Quinoline-Based Deep-Red Emissive Probes for Live-Cell Imaging of Nucleolar RNA.","Small molecular weight fluorescent probes capable of binding to RNAs have been powerful tools for understanding the intracellular behaviors of RNAs. In this chapter, we describe the fluorescence imaging of nucleolar RNA in living cells using deep-red emissive probes with benzo[c,d]indole-quinoline (BIQ) monomethine cyanine scaffolds. These probes feature a significant fluorescence ""off-on"" ability upon binding to RNAs (>100-fold) in the deep-red spectral region (λ<sub>em</sub> > 650 nm). In addition, they have many advantages for fluorescence sensing of RNAs and nucleolar RNA imaging, such as longer emission wavelength, higher photostability, and better counterstaining compatibility for live cell imaging, compared to a commercially available RNA-binding probe, SYTO RNA select.",,,"Humans, Fluorescent Dyes, Quinolines, Indoles, Microscopy, Fluorescence, HeLa Cells, RNA, Molecular Imaging",,

As an example of usage of the new fluorophore, it was conjugated to a ligand targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), one of the widely utilized prostate cancer markers.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Alkynes, Humans, Cycloaddition Reaction, Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II, Molecular Structure, Antigens, Surface, Azides, Male, Prostatic Neoplasms, Ligands",,
39530389,Dye-to-Er<sup>3+</sup> Direct Energy Transfer for Enhancing Up- and Down-conversion Luminescence in Sub-10 nm NaErF<sub>4</sub>.,"Dye sensitization enhances the luminescence of lanthanide nanoparticles by improving light-harvesting. Typically, Yb<sup>3+</sup> serves as an energy bridge but absorbs at a single transition, limiting dyes' options (λ<sub>ex</sub> > 700 nm) due to the spectral overlap requirement. In contrast, the emitter Er<sup>3+</sup> spans energy levels from UV to NIR, making it ideal for multicolor excitation. We developed a strategy to directly sensitize Er<sup>3+</sup> upconversion (UCL) and downconversion luminescence (DCL) by using cyanine dyes. Cy5 demonstrated the greatest enhancement, achieving a 1942-fold UCL and 70-fold DCL increase compared to nanoparticles alone (Er-NPs) under 980 nm excitation. Smaller Er-NPs exhibited brighter dye-sensitized luminescence due to enhanced interfacial energy transfer. A 2 nm inert shell produced the brightest UCL, while thicker shells improved DCL. Dye-sensitized Er<sup>3+</sup> emissions at <sup>2</sup>H<sub>11/2</sub> (525 nm) and <sup>2</sup>P<sub>3/2</sub> (408 nm) enabled temperature monitoring with a maximum sensitivity (<i>S</i><sub>a</sub>) of 3.69%/K. This approach holds significant potential for optical temperature sensing and medical imaging.",,,,,
39519736,Tripodal Quinone-Cyanine G-Quadruplex Ligands as Novel Photosensitizers on Photoinduced Cancer Cell Death.,"Guanine-quadruplex (G4) selective photosensitizers have huge potential for photodynamic therapy against various diseases correlated with G4 DNA and G4 RNAs; however, the types of photosensitizer skeletons available are limited. Herein, we investigated the ability of our original G4 ligands, tripodal quinone-cyanine dyes (tpQCy(s)), which were developed as fluorescent probes for G4, to act as photosensitizers for cancer-selective apoptosis inducers. The results indicated that the tpQCy skeleton has great potential for developing G4-targeted cancer-selective photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy. Among the two tpQCys, only QCy(BnBT)<sub>3</sub>, which has greater G4 selectivity, exhibited photoinduced cytotoxicity in HeLa cell growth, suggesting that the direct oxidation of G4 DNA or RNA is crucial for photoinduced cytotoxicity. RNA-seq analysis using a next-generation sequencing technique revealed that apoptosis was clearly induced by photoirradiation after QCy(BnBT)<sub>3</sub> treatment.",,,"Humans, G-Quadruplexes, Photosensitizing Agents, HeLa Cells, Ligands, Apoptosis, Photochemotherapy, Carbocyanines, Quinones, Neoplasms, Benzoquinones",,
39508506,Exchange of free and capsule conjugated cyanine dyes between cells.,"Fluorescent dyes (especially photoconvertible cyanine dyes) are traditionally used as labels to study single-cell or cell-group interactions and migration. Nevertheless, their application has some disadvantages, such as cytotoxicity and dye transfer between cells during co-cultivation. The latter can lead to serious distortions in research results. At the same time, the lack of a worthy alternative explains the reasons for hushing up this serious problem. Here, we propose low-cytotoxicity encapsulated forms of cyanine 3.5 and cyanine 5.5, enabling intracellular uptake and facilitating single-cell labeling and tracking as an efficient alternative to existing staining. Only 16.9% of myoblasts (C2C12) exchanged encapsulated dyes compared with 99.7% of cells that exchanged the free form of the same dyes. Simultaneous application of several encapsulated cyanine dyes, combined with the possibility of photoconversion, provides multi-color coding of individual cells. Encapsulation of cyanine dyes allows reliable labeling and reduces the transfer of the dyes between cells.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Animals, Mice, Cell Line, Molecular Structure",,
39483716,Deep near infrared light-excited stable synergistic photodynamic and photothermal therapies based on P-IR890 nano-photosensitizer constructed <i>via</i> a non-cyanine dye.,"The cyanine dyes represented by IR780 can achieve synergistic photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) under the stimulation of near-infrared (NIR) light (commonly 808 nm). Unfortunately, the stability of NIR-excited cyanine dyes is not satisfactory. These cyanine dyes can be attacked by self-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) during PDT processes, resulting in structural damage and rapid degradation, which is fatal for phototherapy. To address this issue, a novel non-cyanine dye (IR890) was elaborately designed and synthesized by our team. The maximum absorption wavelength of IR890 was located in the deep NIR region (<i>ca.</i> 890 nm), which was beneficial for further improving tissue penetration depth. Importantly, IR890 exhibited good stability when continuously illuminated by deep NIR light. To improve the hydrophilicity and biocompatibility, the hydrophobic IR890 dye was grafted onto the side chain of hydrophilic polymer (POEGMA-b-PGMA-g-C[bond, triple bond]CH) <i>via</i> click chemistry. Then, the synthesized POEGMA-<i>b</i>-PGMA-<i>g</i>-IR890 amphiphilic polymer was utilized to prepare P-IR890 nano-photosensitizer <i>via</i> self-assembly method. Under irradiation with deep NIR light (850 nm, 0.5 W/cm<sup>2</sup>, 10 min), the dye degradation rate of P-IR890 was less than 5%. However, IR780 was almost completely degraded with the same light output power density and irradiation duration. In addition, P-IR890 could stably generate a large number of ROS and heat at the same time. It was rarely reported that the stable synergistic combination therapy of PDT and PTT could be efficiently performed by a single photosensitizer <i>via</i> irradiation with deep NIR light. P-IR890 exhibited favorable anti-tumor outcomes through apoptosis pathway. Therefore, the P-IR890 could provide a new insight into the design of photosensitizers and new opportunities for synergistic combination therapy of PDT and PTT.",,,,,
39483637,Fluorescent Water-Soluble Polycationic Chitosan Polymers as Markers for Biological 3D Imaging.,"Over the last decades, various tissue-clearing techniques have broken the ground for the optical imaging of whole organs and whole-organisms, providing complete representative data sets of three-dimensional biological structures. Along with advancements in this field, the development of fluorescent markers for staining vessels and capillaries has offered insights into the complexity of vascular networks and their impact on disease progression. Here we describe the use of a modified water-soluble chitosan linked to cyanine dyes in combination with ethyl cinnamate-based optical tissue clearing for the 3D visualization of tissue vasculature in depth. The water-soluble fluorescent Chitosans have proven to be an optimal candidate for labeling both vessels and capillaries <i>ex vivo</i> thanks to their increased water solubility, high photostability, and optical properties in the near-infrared window. In addition, the nontoxicity of these markers broadens their applicability to <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> biological applications. Despite the availability of other fluorescent molecules for vascular staining, the present study, for the first time, demonstrates the potential of fluorescent chitosans to depict vessels at the capillary level and opens avenues for advancing the diagnostic field by reducing the complexity and costs of the currently available procedures.",,,,,
39431849,The electrochemical modulation of single molecule fluorescence.,"Recently it has been shown that electrochemistry, instead of using high intensity lasers, can be used to modulate the intensity of emission of fluorophores and even switch fluorophores between their ON and OFF states as required for single molecule localisation microscopy. This modulation of fluorescence does not necessarily correlate with direct oxidation and reduction of the dyes. Questions arise from this unexpected observation related to what is the electrochemistry that occurs, what are the important variables in switching fluorophores electrochemically and what range of dyes can be modulated with electrochemistry. Herein we seek to answer some of these questions. We demonstrate how to effectively modulate the fluorescence intensity of organic dye-labelled cell samples on an indium tin oxide surface using electrochemistry with redox-active mediators present in an oxygen scavenger buffer. We showed the electrochemical fluorescence modulation is sensitive to the applied potential and the excitation laser intensity, indicating the possibility of coupled photochemical and electrochemical reactions occurring. We also compared the electrochemical fluorescence modulation of representative oxazine, rhodamine, and cyanine dyes using ATTO 655, Alexa Fluor 488, and Alexa Fluor 647. Different dyes with distinctly different structural cores show fluorescence modulation to different extents. The electrochemical fluorescence modulation will be applicable in fluorescence imaging techniques as well as biosensing.",,,,,
39423274,Multivalent supramolecular fluorescent probes for accurate disease imaging.,"Optical imaging is a powerful tool for early disease detection and effective treatment planning, but its accuracy is often compromised by the uptake of imaging materials by the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS). Herein, we leverage multivalent host-guest interactions between cyanine dyes and β-cyclodextrin polymers to develop supramolecular probes with enhanced stability, optical, and transport profiles for accurate in vivo imaging. These multivalent interactions not only ensure the stability of the probes but also enhance fluorescence efficiency by minimizing nonradiative decay. Our self-assembly approach effectively modulates probe size and surface properties, enabling evasion of MPS clearance and promoting prolonged bloodstream circulation, thereby improving the signal-to-background ratio for imaging. The effectiveness of our design is demonstrated by substantial advancements in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury and by providing high-contrast imaging and precise surgical navigation across various tumor models. Our strategy not only advances optical imaging materials toward clinical translation but also establishes a versatile platform applicable to multiple imaging modalities.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Animals, Humans, Optical Imaging, Mice, beta-Cyclodextrins, Neoplasms, Acute Kidney Injury, Carbocyanines",,
39377322,No more gap-shifting: Stochastic many-body-theory based TDHF for accurate theory of polymethine cyanine dyes.,"We introduce an individually fitted screened-exchange interaction for the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) method and show that it resolves the missing binding energies in polymethine organic dye molecules compared to time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT). The interaction kernel, which can be thought of as a dielectric function, is generated by stochastic fitting to the screened-Coulomb interaction of many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), specific to each system. We test our method on the flavylium and indocyanine green dye families with a modifiable length of the polymethine bridge, leading to excitations ranging from visible to short-wave infrared. Our approach validates earlier observations on the importance of inclusion of medium range exchange for the exciton binding energy. Our resulting method, TDHF@vW, also achieves a mean absolute error on a par with MBPT at a computational cost on a par with local-functional TDDFT.",,,,,
39371456,Next-generation red ultra-bright fluorescent dyes for nuclear imaging and peripheral blood leukocytes sorting.,"The nucleus is a membrane-bound organelle in eukaryotic cells and plays a crucial role in cellular processes. Visualizing nuclear morphology is essential for investigating nuclear functions and understanding the relationship between nuclear morphological alterations and multiple diseases. Fluorescent dyes have been developed to visualize nuclear morphology, but the selection of red nuclear-labeling fluorescent dyes remains limited (high price, unknown structure, or high toxicity). Herein, we have developed a red ultra-bright nuclear-targeted dye, BPC1, through the engineering of unsymmetrical cyanine dyes derived from D-π-A systems. BPC1 exhibits ultrahigh fluorescence brightness and exceptional cell permeability, and selectively stains nuclear DNA rather than mitochondrial DNA, enabling the visualization of the nucleus in diverse cells at extremely low doses (100 nM) and laser power (0.8 μW). Furthermore, BPC1 is utilized for nuclear staining in blood cells, aiding in the distinct visualization of the white blood cell nucleus and facilitating the identification and enumeration of various leukocyte types. Our study implies considerable commercial potential for BPC1 and underscores its capacity to serve as a powerful tool in life sciences and cell biology research.",,,,,
39313994,Achieving Ultra-Narrow-Band Deep-Red Electroluminescence By a Soliton-type Dye Squaraine.,"Due to the soliton-like electronic structural characteristics, cyanine dyes typically exhibit spectral behaviors such as large molar extinction coefficients, narrow spectra, and high fluorescence efficiency. However, their extensive applications as emitters in electroluminescence are largely ignored due to their serious emission quenching in the aggregation state. Herein, it is reported a squaraine dye (a type of cyanine) SQPhEt. At different solution concentrations, the unusual decrease in full-width at half-maxima (FWHM) with increasing Stokes shift indicates the fluorescence quenching of SQPhEt in the aggregated state is because of the strong self-absorption effect. A sensitized device structure can help to reduce the doping concentration of dye, which can effectively suppress self-absorption. Benefitting from the large molar extinction coefficient of SQPhEt, even at low doping concentrations of 0.1 wt%, efficient Förster energy transfer can be achieved. The corresponding spin-coating sensitized device based on SQPhEt as the dopant exhibits favorable deep-red emission at 668 nm with a small FWHM of 0.10 eV.",,,,,
39303384,Engineering of exosome-liposome hybrid-based theranostic nanomedicines for NIR-II fluorescence imaging-guided and targeted NIR-II photothermal therapy of subcutaneous glioblastoma.,"Exosome-liposome hybrid-based vehicles (ELV) are promising carriers for cancer treatment, but there are rare efficient theranostic probes to label their lipid bilayer membrane for precisely tracing biodistribution and execute potent therapy. As both fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II) has intrinsically deep penetration and high efficacy to ablate tumors, herein the design and synthesis of lipophilic NIR-II cyanine dyes with strong donor strength is reported to label lipid bilayer membrane of ELV for NIR-II fluorescence image-guided and targeted NIR-II photothermal treatment of subcutaneous glioblastoma. Via lipid film hydration and subsequent extrusion method, the synthesized ELV (NIR-C<sub>12</sub>-EL) is formulated with NIR-C<sub>12</sub> labeling, cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid decoration, liposomal PEGylation, and biological exosome function. NIR-C<sub>12</sub>-EL exhibits excellent colloidal stability, good biocompatibility, strong light harvesting capability, high NIR-II photoconversion efficiency (62.28 %), and targeting capability to diagnose and ablate tumors, which together contribute to the extended life-span of the mice treatment with NIR-C<sub>12</sub>-EL and continuous 1064 nm laser irradiation. This study provides insight into not only designing of lipophilic NIR-II fluorescence probes for labeling of exosome-liposome hybrid-based vehicles but also the engineering of theranostic nanoplatforms for precise treatment of glioblastoma.",,,"Glioblastoma, Theranostic Nanomedicine, Liposomes, Animals, Photothermal Therapy, Mice, Optical Imaging, Exosomes, Humans, Infrared Rays, Mice, Nude, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Survival, Particle Size",,
39282648,Chiroptical properties of cyanine aggregates: hierarchical modelling from monomers to bundles.,"Some achiral cyanine dyes form well-ordered chiral assemblies exhibiting pronounced Circular Dichroism (CD) and Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL). Notably, achiral C8O3 cyanines self-assemble into tubular J-aggregates, which further organize into bundles displaying bisignate CD spectrum - hallmark of an exciton coupled system - and an unusual bisignated CPL. In contrast, the tubular aggregates display a monosignate CD spectrum. The mechanism underlying these intriguing features remains elusive. In the present work, a quantum-mechanical exciton model is proposed to elucidate the (chir)optical behaviour of C8O3 aggregates. A herringbone arrangement of C8O3 dyes within the tubular aggregates well reproduces the observed spectral signatures. The anomalous observation of a singular CD peak in tubular aggregates is ascribed to the intrinsic chirality of the monomeric units inside the aggregate, whereas the CD doublet characterizing the bundles is attributed to the exciton coupling between the constituent tubes. The bisignated CPL signal observed in bundles reveals significant anti-Kasha emission at room temperature and is quantitatively addressed accounting for a very tiny exciton splitting leading to a sizable thermal population of both exciton states. This study provides crucial insights on the complexity of C8O3 aggregation and on the origin of chiroptical response at various aggregation stages.",,,,,
39264146,Tannic Acid-Based Self-Assembling Nanocarriers with Antiphotobleaching and Controlled Releasing Properties for Collaborative Near-Infrared Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy.,"Near-infrared (NIR) organic materials have been widely developed for tumor phototherapy due to their deep tumor penetration, good biodegradability, and high photothermal conversion (PCE). However, most of the NIR organic dyes are easily destroyed by photooxidation due to their big and long conjugated structures, such as cyanine dyes. Under light irradiation, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by these NIR dyes can easily break their conjugated skeleton, resulting in a dramatic decrease in phototherapeutic efficiency. Herein, an NIR organic dye cyanine dye (CyS) and a photosensitizer methylene blue (MB) were chosen to prepare nanocarrier CMTNPs by facile self-assembling with a natural antioxidant, tannic acid (TA). TA can greatly enhance the stability of NIR cyanine dyes by scavenging ROS. Furthermore, CMTNPs have a character of pH/thermal dual response, allowing for controlled release of MB in the slightly acidic tumor environment during photothermal therapy. The released MB can turn on both fluorescence and photodynamic therapy effects. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated the remarkable tumor ablation ability of CMTNPs. Thus, our study provided an antiphotobleaching and controlled release photosensitizer strategy through the introduction of antioxidant TA into the nanocarrier for efficient collaborative photothermal/photodynamic therapy.",,,"Tannins, Photochemotherapy, Animals, Mice, Photosensitizing Agents, Humans, Nanoparticles, Methylene Blue, Infrared Rays, Photothermal Therapy, Drug Carriers, Reactive Oxygen Species, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Polyphenols",,
39239835,Visualization of Diabetes Progression by an Activatable NIR-IIb Luminescent Probe.,"Developing NIR-IIb luminescence probes with rapid visualization and a high penetration depth is essential for diabetes research. Combining a sensitizing switch with lanthanide-doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) has been employed to fabricate the NIR-IIb probes. However, these probes mainly adopt heptamethine cyanine dye as the antenna, and the NIR-IIb signal is activated by inhibiting the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of the dye. Due to limited recognition units, this strategy makes many biomolecules undetectable, such as cysteine (Cys), which is closely related to diabetes. Herein, in this article, hemicyanine dye, NFL-OH, was verified as a new antenna to sensitize NIR-IIb emission from LnNPs. Unlike traditional cyanine dyes, hemicyanine's fluorescence intensity can also be modulated by intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), thereby expanding the range of detectable targets for NIR-IIb probes based on sensitization mechanism. Through switching the hemicyanine-sensitized NIR-IIb emission, we successfully fabricated an NFL-Cys-LnNPs' nanoprobe, which can effectively monitor Cys concentration in the liver of diabetic mice during diabetes progression and evaluate the efficacy of diabetic drugs. Our work not only presents an excellent tool for Cys imaging but also introduces new concepts for designing NIR-IIb probes.",,,"Animals, Mice, Fluorescent Dyes, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental, Cysteine, Infrared Rays, Optical Imaging, Nanoparticles, Carbocyanines, Disease Progression, Humans, Male",,
39152945,Regulating Charge Transfer in Cyanine Dyes: A Universal Methodology for Enhancing Cancer Phototherapeutic Efficacy.,"ConspectusDue to the advantages of spatiotemporal selectivity and inherent noninvasiveness, cancer phototherapy, which includes both photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), has garnered significant attention in recent years as a promising cancer treatment. Despite the commendable progress in this field, persistent challenges remain. In PDT, limitations in dyes manifest as low intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency and oxygen-dependent photoactivity, resulting in unsatisfactory performance, particularly under hypoxic conditions. Similarly, PTT encounters consistent insufficiencies in the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of dyes. Additionally, the suboptimal phototherapeutic efficacy often exhibits a limited immune response. These factors collectively impose significant constraints on phototherapy in oncological applications, leading to limited tumor inhibition, tumor recurrence, and even metastasis.Unlike strategies that rely on external assistance with complicated systems, manipulating excited-state deactivation pathways in biocompatible dyes offers a universal way to systematically address these challenges. Our group has devoted considerable effort to achieving this goal. In this Account, we present and discuss our journey in optimizing excited-state energy-release pathways through regulating molecular charge transfer based on cyanine dyes, which are renowned for their exceptional photophysical properties and harmonious biocompatibility. The investigation begins with the introduction of amino groups in the <i>meso</i> position of a heptamethine cyanine dye, where the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect causes a significant enlargement of the Stokes shift. Subsequently, ICT induced by introducing functional electron-deficient groups in cyanines is found to decrease the overlap of electron distribution or narrow the energy gaps of molecular frontier orbitals. Such modifications result in a reduction of the energy gaps between singlet and triplet states or an improvement in internal conversion, ultimately promoting phototherapy efficacy in both primary and distant tumors. Furthermore, with the intensification of the charge transfer effect aided by light, photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer occurs in some cyanines, leading to complete charge separation in the excited state. This process enhances the transition to the ground or triplet states, improving tumor phototherapy and inhibiting metastasis by increasing the PCE or the yield of reactive oxygen species, respectively. Shifting focus from intramolecular to intermolecular interactions, we successfully constructed and explored cyanines based on intermolecular charge transfer. These dyes, with excited-state dynamics mimicking natural photosynthesis, generate radicals and facilitate oxygen-independent hypoxic tumor PDT. Finally, we outlined the existing challenges and future directions for optimizing phototherapeutic efficacy by regulating molecular charge transfer.

39127295,Type II photoinitiators with collagen-based cyanine for cell encapsulation under green-red LED.,"3D bioprinting with cell-laden materials is an emerging technique for fabricating functional tissue constructs. However, current cell-laden bioinks often lack sufficient cytocompatibility with commonly used UV-light sources. In this study, green to red photoinduced hydrogel crosslinking was obtained by introducing synthesized biosafety photoinitiators and used in light-based direct ink writing (DIW) 3D printing for enabling cell encapsulation successfully. The novel type II photointiators contain iodonium (ONI) and synthesized cyanine dyes CZBIN, TDPABIN, Col-SH-CZ, and Col-SH-TD with strong absorption in the range of 400-600 nm. Collagen-based macromolecule dyes Col-SH-CZ and Col-SH-TD showed excellent cytocompatibility. The photochemistry of these photoinitiators revealed an efficient photoinduced electron transfer (PET) process from the singlet excited states of the dyes to iodonium (ONI), facilitating the crosslinking of the biogels. L929 cells were encapsulated in Gel-MA hydrogels containing various photoinitiating systems and exposed to near-ultraviolet, green, or red LED irradiation. DIW-type 3D printing of Gel-MA bioink with L929 cells was also evaluated. The cell viability achieved with green light encapsulation reached 90 %.

39105720,Molecular Dynamical and Quantum Mechanical Exploration of the Site-Specific Dynamics of Cy3 Dimers Internally Linked to dsDNA.,"Performing spectroscopic measurements on biomolecules labeled with fluorescent probes is a powerful approach to locating the molecular behavior and dynamics of large systems at specific sites within their local environments. The indocarbocyanine dye Cy3 has emerged as one of the most commonly used chromophores. The incorporation of Cy3 dimers into DNA enhances experimental resolution owing to the spectral characteristics influenced by the geometric orientation of excitonically coupled monomeric units. Various theoretical models and simulations have been utilized to aid in the interpretation of the experimental spectra. In this study, we employ all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the structural dynamics of Cy3 dimers internally linked to the dsDNA backbone. We used quantum mechanical calculations to derive insights from both the linear absorption spectra and the circular dichroism data. Furthermore, we explore potential limitations within a commonly used force field for cyanine dyes. The molecular dynamics simulations suggest the presence of four possible Cy3 dimeric populations. The spectral simulations on the four populations show one of them to agree better with the experimental signatures, suggesting it to be the dominant population. The relative orientation of Cy3 in this population compares very well with previous predictions from the Holstein-Frenkel Hamiltonian model.",,,"Carbocyanines, Dimerization, DNA, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Quantum Theory",,
39046341,Bright and Fast Emission from Robust Supramolecular J-Aggregate Nanostructures through Silica-Encapsulation.,"We introduce a two-step silica-encapsulation procedure to optimize both the optical efficiency and structural robustness of 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC), a two-dimensional sheet-like J-aggregate. We report a fluorescence quantum yield of ∼98%, the highest quantum yield recorded for any J-aggregate structure at room temperature, and a fast, emissive lifetime of 234 ps. Silica, as an encapsulating matrix, provides optical transparency, chemical inertness, and robustness to dilution, while rigidifying the J-aggregate structure. Our in situ encapsulation process preserves the excitonic structure in TDBC J-aggregates, maintaining their light absorption and emission properties. The homogeneous silica coating has an average thickness of 0.5-1 nm around J-aggregate sheets. Silica encapsulation permits extensive dilutions of J-aggregates without significant disintegration into monomers. The narrow absorbance and emission line widths exhibit further narrowing upon cooling to 79 K, which is consistent with J-type coupling in the encapsulated aggregates. This silica TDBC J-aggregate construct signifies (1) a bright, fast, and robust fluorophore system, (2) a platform for further manipulation of J-aggregates as building blocks for integration with other optical materials and structures, and (3) a system for fundamental studies of exciton delocalization, transport, and emission dynamics within a rigid matrix.",,,,,
39034639,Pyrrolopyrrole Cyanine J-Aggregate Nanoparticles with High Near-Infrared Fluorescence Brightness and Photothermal Performance for Efficient Phototheranostics.,"Advanced photosensitizers for high-performance fluorescence imaging-guided photothermal therapy demand excellent near-infrared (NIR) brightness [molar absorption coefficient (ε) × quantum yield (QY)] and exceptional photothermal performance [ε × photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE)]. However, integrating high brightness and potent photothermal performance within a single molecule faces a formidable challenge. This article proposes a method to address this issue by preparing J-aggregate nanoparticles (NPs) using molecules with high ε. J-aggregates effectively improve QY and induce molecular emission redshift, while high ε molecules play a crucial role in improving the brightness and photothermal performance. By optimizing the molecular structure based on the pyrrolopyrrole cyanine (PPCy), precise control over the QY and PCE of PPCy J-aggregates is achieved. Ultimately, PDDO NPs exhibiting superior brightness (ε × QY = 3.32 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) and photothermal performance (ε × PCE = 1.21 × 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-1</sup>) are identified as high-performance photosensitizers.

39007528,Self-Reporting Conjugated Polymer Nanoparticles for Superoxide Generation and Detection.,"Conjugated polymer nanoparticles (CPNs or Pdots) have become increasingly popular fluorophores for multimodal applications that combine imaging with phototherapeutic effects. Reports of CPNs in photodynamic therapy applications typically focus on their ability to generate singlet oxygen. Alternatively, CPN excited states can interact with oxygen to form superoxide radical anion and a CPN-based hole polaron, both of which can have deleterious effects on fluorescence properties. Here, we demonstrate that CPNs prepared from the common conjugated polymer poly[(9,9-dioctylfluorenyl-2,7-diyl)-<i>alt</i>-co-(1,4-benzo-{2,1',3}-thiadiazole)] (PFBT, also known as F8BT) generate superoxide upon irradiation. We use the same CPNs to detect superoxide by doping them with a superoxide-responsive hydrocyanine dye developed by Murthy and co-workers. Superoxide induces off-to-on fluorescence switching by converting quenching hydrocyanine dyes to fluorescent cyanine dyes that act as fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) acceptors for PFBT chromophores. Amplified FRET from the multichromophoric CPNs yields fluorescence signal intensities that are nearly 50 times greater than when the dye is excited directly or over 100 times greater when signal readout is from the CPN channel. The dye loading level governs the maximum amount of superoxide that induces a change in fluorescence properties and also influences the rate of superoxide generation by furnishing competitive excited state deactivation pathways. These results suggest that CPNs can be used to deliver superoxide in applications in which it is desirable and provide a caution for fluorescence-based CPN applications in which superoxide can damage fluorophores.",,,,,
38995885,Syntheses and Applications of Coumarin-Derived Fluorescent Probes for Real-Time Monitoring of NAD(P)H Dynamics in Living Cells across Diverse Chemical Environments.,"Fluorescent probes play a crucial role in elucidating cellular processes, with NAD(P)H sensing being pivotal in understanding cellular metabolism and redox biology. Here, the development and characterization of three fluorescent probes, <b>A</b>, <b>B</b>, and <b>C</b>, based on the coumarin platform for monitoring of NAD(P)H levels in living cells are described. Probes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> incorporate a coumarin-cyanine hybrid structure with vinyl and thiophene connection bridges to 3-quinolinium acceptors, respectively, while probe <b>C</b> introduces a dicyano moiety for replacement of the lactone carbonyl group of probe <b>A</b> which increases the reaction rate of the probe with NAD(P)H. Initially, all probes exhibit subdued fluorescence due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) quenching. However, upon hydride transfer by NAD(P)H, fluorescence activation is triggered through enhanced ICT. Theoretical calculations confirm that the electronic absorption changes upon the addition of hydride to originate from the quinoline moiety instead of the coumarin section and end up in the middle section, illustrating how the addition of hydride affects the nature of this absorption. Control and dose-response experiments provide conclusive evidence of probe <b>C</b>'s specificity and reliability in identifying intracellular NAD(P)H levels within HeLa cells. Furthermore, colocalization studies indicate probe <b>C</b>'s selective targeting of mitochondria. Investigation into metabolic substrates reveals the influence of glucose, maltose, pyruvate, lactate, acesulfame potassium, and aspartame on NAD(P)H levels, shedding light on cellular responses to nutrient availability and artificial sweeteners.

38995720,Thermal Truncation of Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes.,"Cyanine dyes are a class of organic, usually cationic molecules containing two nitrogen centers linked through conjugated polymethine chains. The synthesis and reactivity of cyanine derivatives have been extensively investigated for decades. Unlike the recently described phototruncation process, the thermal truncation (chain shortening) reaction is a phenomenon that has rarely been reported for these important fluorophores. Here, we present a systematic investigation of the truncation of heptamethine cyanines (Cy7) to pentamethine (Cy5) and trimethine (Cy3) cyanines via homogeneous, acid-base-catalyzed nucleophilic exchange reactions. We demonstrate how different substituents at the C3' and C4' positions of the chain and different heterocyclic end groups, the presence of bases, nucleophiles, and oxygen, solvent properties, and temperature affect the truncation process. The mechanism of chain shortening, studied by various analytical and spectroscopic techniques, was verified by extensive <i>ab initio</i> calculation, implying the necessity to model catalytic reactions by highly correlated wave function-based methods. In this study, we provide critical insight into the reactivity of cyanine polyene chains and elucidate the truncation mechanism and methods to mitigate side processes that can occur during the synthesis of cyanine derivatives. In addition, we offer alternative routes to the preparation of symmetrical and unsymmetrical <i>meso</i>-substituted Cy5 derivatives.",,,,,

38960111,Polypeptide nanoparticles conjugated with an NIR-II organic dye for TRPV1 channel blockade enhance mild phototheranostics.,"Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted attention as a highly effective non-invasive treatment method. However, the high localized temperatures (>50 °C) required for its treatment will inevitably cause damage to the surrounding normal tissues. Therefore, it is important to develop novel and effective strategies to achieve mild photothermal therapy (mPTT). The overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), a widespread heat stress protein, leads to the generation of heat resistance in cancer cells, which seriously affects the therapeutic effect. Thus, inhibiting the expression of HSPs to reduce the heat resistance of tumor cells is expected to enhance the therapeutic effect of mPTT. Here, we successfully synthesized a fluorescent probe bonded with an amphiphilic polypeptide to a cyanine dye and achieved physical encapsulation of the blocker SB705498 through a self-assembly process. SB705498 promotes transient receptor potential vanilloid member 1 (TRPV1) channel blockade that can inhibit the translocation of the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF 1) by blocking the influx of calcium and thus affecting the expression of HSPs, which has the potential to enhance the thermotherapy of cancer under mild conditions. In addition, the nanoparticles enabled NIR-II fluorescence imaging with good stability and high photothermal conversion efficiency (48.10 %). Therefore, this study provides a new strategy for realizing precise mPTT(<45 °C) guided by NIR-II imaging. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Inhibition of overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) in cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) is expected to enhance the therapeutic effect of mild photothermal therapy (mPTT). In this study, we synthesized a fluorescent probe bonded to cyanine dyes with amphiphilic polypeptides and physically wrapped the blocker SB705498 through a self-assembly process. As a transient receptor potential vanillin 1 (TRPV1) channel blocker, SB705498 inhibits heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) translocation by blocking calcium ion influx, thereby improving mPTT efficacy by inhibiting the expression of HSPs. The nanoparticles also enable NIR-II fluorescence imaging with good stability and high photothermal conversion efficiency (48.10 %).

38958530,An Intramolecular Rotor-Bridged Dimeric Cyanine Photothermal Transducer for Efficient Near-Infrared II Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Mitochondria-Targeted Phototherapy.,"Near-infrared (NIR) heptamethine cyanine (HCy) dyes are promising photothermal transducers for image-guided cancer treatment owing to their prominent photophysical properties and high photothermal conversion ability. However, HCy photothermal transducers usually have poor photostability due to degradation induced by the self-generated reactive oxygen species. Herein, a novel mitochondria-targeting dimeric HCy dye, named dimeric oBHCy, is rationally designed, exhibiting strong near-infrared II (NIR-II) fluorescence emission, high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), and excellent photostability. The large π-conjugation and drastic intramolecular motion of the diphenol rotor in the dimeric oBHCy enhance the nonradiative energy dissipation and suppress the intersystem crossing process, thereby achieving a high PCE (49.2%) and improved photostability. Impressively, dimeric oBHCy can precisely target mitochondria and induce mitochondrial damage upon NIR light irradiation. Under the guidance of in vivo NIR-II fluorescence imaging, efficient NIR light-activated photothermal therapy of 4T1 breast tumors is accomplished with a tumor inhibitory rate of 96% following a single injection of the dimeric oBHCy.

38955070,Indopolycarbocyanine dyes as perspective analytical reagents for spectrophotometric determination of nitrite by radical nitration.,"A spectrophotometric method for the quantitative determination of nitrite was developed, based on the radical nitration of indopolycarbocyanine dyes in the presence of 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO). The rate of the reaction of the studied dyes with nitrite increases with the lengthening of the polymethine chain and the presence of hydrophilic sulfo groups in the side chain of the dye. TEMPO acts as a co-reagent, significantly accelerating the reaction rate and increasing the sensitivity of nitrite determination. The proposed reaction mechanism is supported by spectrophotometric and HPLC/MS studies. For Ind2 (tetramethine indocarbocyanine cationic dye), the limit of detection for nitrite is 0.50 µM within a linearity range of 1-13 µM. The developed method is sensitive, with a LOD 130 times lower than the maximum contaminant level (MCL) of nitrite in drinking water (65 μM), as specified by the WHO. The method is of low-toxicity and good selectivity, as the determination of nitrite is not significantly affected by the main components of water.

However, their potential in longitudinal optoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy remains limited due to challenges such as poor chemical stability, poor photostability, and low photothermal conversion. In this study, we present a new structural modification for cyanine dyes by introducing a strongly electron-withdrawing group (barbiturate), resulting in a new series of barbiturate-cyanine dyes (BC810, BC885, and BC1010) with suppressed fluorescence and enhanced stability. Furthermore, the introduction of BC1010 into block copolymers (PEG<sub>114</sub>-b-PCL<sub>60</sub>) induces aggregation-caused quenching, further boosting the photothermal performance. The photophysical properties of nanoparticles (BC1010-NPs) include their remarkably broad absorption range from 900 to 1200 nm for optoacoustic imaging, allowing imaging applications in NIR-I and NIR-II windows. The combined effect of these strategies, including improved photostability, enhanced nonradiative relaxation, and aggregation-caused quenching, enables the detection of optoacoustic signals with high sensitivity and effective photothermal treatment of in vivo tumor models when BC1010-NPs are administered before irradiation with a 1064 nm laser.

38852304,"Spectral-fluorescent study of substituted trimethine cyanine dyes in solutions and in complexes with DNA. Effects of aggregation, moderate heating, and decreasing pH.","Trimethine cyanine dyes are widely used as probes for the detection, study and quantification of biomolecules. In particular, cationic trimethine cyanines noncovalently interact with DNA with growing fluorescence. However, their use is often limited by the tendency to self-association - to the formation of aggregates. Disubstituted trimethine cyanines with hydrophobic substituents are especially prone to aggregation. In this work, we studied the interaction of a number of substituted trimethine cyanines with DNA (in aqueous buffer solutions) and showed that their aggregation strongly interfered with their use as fluorescent probes for DNA. To eliminate this drawback, preliminary heating of dye solutions with DNA to 60-70 °C was used, followed by cooling to room temperature. Compared to the experiments without heating, an increase in the dye fluorescence intensity was observed due to the partial thermal decomposition of the aggregates and the interaction of the resulting monomers with DNA. To decompose aggregates, another method was also used - protonation of the dyes with amino substituents in buffer solutions with pH 5.0, which also led to growing the dye fluorescence intensity in the presence of DNA. Complexes of the dyes with DNA were modeled using molecular docking. Effective binding constants of the dyes to DNA and detection limits when using the dyes as probes for DNA (LOD and LOQ) were determined. It is shown that dye 3 with heating in neutral buffer and dye 1 in acidic buffer may be recommended as sensitive probes for DNA. It is concluded that the method of preliminary heating may be applied to dyes prone to aggregation, for improving their properties as biomolecular probes. Another possible means to reduce the interfering effects of dye aggregates is to use easily protonated dyes (with amino substituents) in slightly acidic media.",,,"DNA, Carbocyanines, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Fluorescent Dyes, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Molecular Docking Simulation, Solutions, Hot Temperature, Animals",,

However, optoacoustic imaging of enzyme activity would require loud, photostable, NIR-absorbing molecular contrast agents, which remain unknown. Most organic molecular contrast agents are repurposed fluorophores, with severe shortcomings of photoinstability or phototoxicity under optoacoustic imaging, as consequences of their slow S<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>0</sub> electronic relaxation. We now report that known fluorophores can be rationally modified to reach ultrafast S<sub>1</sub>→S<sub>0</sub> rates, without much extra molecular complexity, simply by merging them with molecular switches. Here, we merge azobenzene switches with cyanine dyes to give ultrafast relaxation (<10 ps, >100-fold faster). Without even adapting instrument settings, these azohemicyanines display outstanding improvements in signal longevity (>1000-fold increase of photostability) and signal loudness (>3-fold even at time zero). We show why this simple but unexplored design strategy can still offer stronger performance in the future, and can also increase the spatial resolution and the quantitative linearity of photoacoustic response over extended longitudinal imaging. By bringing the world of molecular switches and rotors to bear on problems facing optoacoustic agents, this practical strategy will help to unleash the full potential of optoacoustic imaging in fundamental studies and translational uses.",,,"Azo Compounds, Photoacoustic Techniques, Fluorescent Dyes, Carbocyanines, Humans, Infrared Rays, Molecular Structure, Optical Imaging",,

Although the molecular mechanism behind the structure-inherent tumor targeting of IR-783 has not been well-demonstrated, IR-783 has unique properties such as a good water solubility and low cytotoxicity compared with other commercial heptamethine cyanine dyes. The goal of this study is to evaluate the phototherapeutic efficacy of IR-783 as a tumor-targeted photothermal agent in human colorectal cancer xenografts.

Furthermore, the IR-783 dye reveals the superior capability to convert NIR light into heat energy under 808 nm NIR laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing cancer cell death. Taken together, these findings suggest that water-soluble anionic IR-783 can be used as a bifunctional phototherapeutic agent for the targeted imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) of colorectal cancer.

Remolding such structures to realize detection of unclarified biotargets or interfering with them seems to be important in the field of chemical biology. In this study, we developed a fluorescent ligand (IR1) targeting mitochondrial G-quadruplexes (mitoG4s) by a slight variation on the typical NIR scaffold (IR780). This ligand could be applied for sensing mitoG4s by fluorescence, making it different from the unmodified dye whose fluorescence was quenched by mitoG4s. Then, IR1 was demonstrated to accumulate in the mitochondria through a mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dependent manner. Some of IR1 then bound to mitoG4s, causing mtDNA loss and mitochondrial dysfunction, which thereby triggered PANoptosis, including apoptosis, autophagy and pyroptosis. To the best of our knowledge, IR1 was the first NIR fluorescent ligand with emission centered at above 800 nm for mitoG4s, and the first example causing PANoptosis among the reported mitoG4-targeted ligands.",,,"Humans, Apoptosis, Carbocyanines, DNA, Mitochondrial, Fluorescent Dyes, G-Quadruplexes, Ligands, Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial, Mitochondria, HCT116 Cells, DNA Copy Number Variations",,

Among the various genetic risk factors for AD, apoE4 gene plays a pivotal role in the onset and progression of AD, and detection of apoE4 gene holds significance for prevention and early diagnosis of AD. Herein, dual-signal fluorescence detection of fragments associated with apoE ε4 allele near codon 112 (Tc1) and codon 158 (Tc2) was achieved using DNA tetrahedron nanostructure (DTN). The Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) process in the DTN was initiated in which the nucleic acid intercalating dye thiazole orange (TO) served as the donor and the cyanine dyes of cyanine3 (Cy3) and cyanine5 (Cy5) at the two vertices of DTN served as the acceptors. In the presence of Tc1 and Tc2, the FRET process between TO and the cyanine dyes was hindered by the enzymatic cleavage reaction, which ensures the dual-signal fluorescence assay of apoE4 gene sites. The limit of detection for Tc1 and Tc2 was estimated to be 0.82 nM and 0.77 nM, respectively, and the whole assay was accomplished within 1 h on a microplate reader. The proposed method thus possesses the advantages of easy operation, short detection time, and high-throughput capability.",,,"Apolipoprotein E4, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Humans, Fluorescent Dyes, DNA, Carbocyanines, Benzothiazoles, Nanostructures, Quinolines, Limit of Detection",,
38617658,Shielding Effects Provide a Dominant Mechanism in J-Aggregation-Induced Photoluminescence Enhancement of Carbon Nanotubes.,"The unique photophysical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) exhibit great potential for bioimaging applications. This led to extensive exploration of photosensitization methods to improve their faint shortwave infrared (SWIR) photoluminescence. Here, we report the mechanisms of SWCNT-assisted J-aggregation of cyanine dyes and the associated photoluminescence enhancement of SWCNTs in the SWIR spectral region. Surprisingly, we found that excitation energy transfer between the cyanine dyes and SWCNTs makes a negligible contribution to the overall photoluminescence enhancement. Instead, the shielding of SWCNTs from the surrounding water molecules through hydrogen bond-assisted macromolecular reorganization of ionic surfactants triggered by counterions and the physisorption of the dye molecules on the side walls of SWCNTs play a primary role in the photoluminescence enhancement of SWCNTs. We observed 2 orders of magnitude photoluminescence enhancement of SWCNTs by optimizing these factors. Our findings suggest that the proper shielding of SWCNTs is the critical factor for their photoluminescence enhancement, which has important implications for their application as imaging agents in biological settings.",,,,,
38559725,DNA Framework-Engineered Assembly of Cyanine Dyes for Structural Identification of Nucleic Acids.,"DNA nanostructures serve as precise templates for organizing organic dyes, enabling the creation of programmable artificial photonic systems with efficient light-harvesting and energy transfer capabilities. However, regulating the organization of organic dyes on DNA frameworks remains a great challenge. In this study, we investigated the factors influencing the self-assembly behavior of cyanine dye K21 on DNA frameworks. We observed that K21 exhibited diverse assembly modes, including monomers, H-aggregates, J-aggregates, and excimers, when combined with DNA frameworks. By manipulating conditions such as the ion concentration, dye concentration, and structure of DNA frameworks, we successfully achieved precise control over the assembly modes of K21. Leveraging K21's microenvironment-sensitive fluorescence properties on DNA nanostructures, we successfully discriminated between the chirality and topology structures of physiologically relevant G-quadruplexes. This study provides valuable insights into the factors influencing the dynamic assembly behavior of organic dyes on DNA framework nanostructures, offering new perspectives for constructing functional supramolecular aggregates and identifying DNA secondary structures.",,,,,
38557031,Stable Super-Resolution Imaging of Cell Membrane Nanoscale Subcompartment Dynamics with a Buffering Cyanine Dye.,"Super-resolution fluorescence imaging is a crucial method for visualizing the dynamics of the cell membrane involved in various physiological and pathological processes. This requires bright fluorescent dyes with excellent photostability and labeling stability to enable long-term imaging. In this context, we introduce a buffering-strategy-based cyanine dye, <b>SA-Cy5</b>, designed to identify and label carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) located in the cell membrane. The unique feature of <b>SA-Cy5</b> lies in its ability to overcome photobleaching. When the dye on the cell membrane undergoes photobleaching, it is rapidly replaced by an intact probe from the buffer pool outside the cell membrane. This dynamic replacement ensures that the fluorescence intensity on the cell membrane remains stable over time. Under the super-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM), the cell membrane can be continuously imaged for 60 min with a time resolution of 20 s. This extended imaging period allows for the observation of substructural dynamics of the cell membrane, including the growth and fusion of filamentous pseudopodia and the fusion of vesicles. Additionally, this buffering strategy introduces a novel approach to address the issue of poor photostability associated with the cyanine dyes.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Cell Membrane, Optical Imaging",,
38557012,Biocompatible and Water-Soluble Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR)-Emitting Cyanine-Based Fluorescent Probes for In Vivo Multiplexed Molecular Imaging.,"Extending molecular imaging into the shortwave-infrared (SWIR, 900-1400 nm) region provides deep tissue visualization of biomolecules in the living system resulting from the low tissue autofluorescence and scattering. Looking at the Food and Drug Administration-approved and clinical trial near-infrared (NIR) probes, only indocyanine green (ICG) and its analogues have been approved for biomedical applications. Excitation wavelength less than 800 nm limits these probes from deep tissue penetration and noninvasive fluorescence imaging. Herein, we present the synthesis of ICG-based π-conjugation-extended cyanine dyes, ICG-C9 and ICG-C11 as biocompatible, and water-soluble SWIR-emitting probes with emission wavelengths of 922 and 1010 nm in water, respectively. Also, ICG-, ICG-C9-, and ICG-C11-based fluorescent labeling agents have been synthesized for the development of SWIR molecular imaging probes. Using the fluorescence of ICG, ICG-C9, and ICG-C11, we demonstrate three-color SWIR fluorescence imaging of breast tumors by visualizing surface receptors (EGFR and HER2) and tumor vasculature in living mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate two-color SWIR fluorescence imaging of breast tumor apoptosis using an ICG-conjugated anticancer drug, Kadcyla and ICG-C9 or ICG-C11-conjugated annexin V. Finally, we show long-term (38 days) SWIR fluorescence imaging of breast tumor shrinkage induced by Kadcyla. This study provides a general strategy for multiplexed fluorescence molecular imaging with biocompatible and water-soluble SWIR-emitting cyanine probes.",,,"Animals, Mice, Humans, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine, Indocyanine Green, Molecular Imaging, Optical Imaging, Breast Neoplasms",,
38522377,A novel pH-sensitive hemi-cyanine containing tetrahydropyridine ring near-infrared fluorescence probe with lysosome-targeting ability.,"In recent years, hemi-cyanine dyes have been widely used as biological probes due to their red-light emission characteristics and high fluorescence quantum yield. In this study, we synthesized a novel hemi-cyanine dye containing a tetrahydropyridine ring. A lysosomal target was introduced into its structure to create a new pH-sensitive near-infrared fluorescent probe that successfully targeted lysosomes. The results showed that when the probe solution was excited at the absorption wavelength of 650 nm, its fluorescence emission wavelength was about 700 nm, and the peak intensity changed with different pH values in a wide range. Therefore, this probe enabled non-invasive detection of changes in the acidic environment of lysosomes in living organisms and showed good imaging capabilities. Moreover, the probe displays high sensitivity and good stability. The theoretical calculation of a probe structure has also been completed to discuss the relationship between structure and property.",,,"Humans, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Lysosomes, Quinolines, HeLa Cells",,
38505973,Nanoassemblies of heptamethine cyanine dye-initiated poly(amino acid) enhance ROS generation for effective antitumour phototherapy.,"Phototherapy shows great potential for pinpoint tumour treatment. Heptamethine cyanine dyes like IR783 have high potential as agents for antitumour phototherapy due to their inherent tumour targeting ability, though their effectiveness <i>in vivo</i> is unsatisfactory for clinical translation. To overcome this limitation, we present an innovative strategy involving IR783-based polymeric nanoassemblies that improve the dye's performance as an antitumoural photosensitizer. In the formulation, IR783 is modified with cysteamine and used to initiate the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of the <i>N</i>-carboxyanhydride of benzyl-L-aspartate (BLA), resulting in IR783-installed poly(BLA). Compared to free IR783, the IR783 dye in the polymer adopts a twisted molecular conformation and tuned electron orbital distribution, remarkably enhancing its optical properties. In aqueous environments, the polymers spontaneously assemble into nanostructures with 60 nm diameter, showcasing surface-exposed IR783 dyes that function as ligands for cancer cell and mitochondria targeting. Moreover, the nanoassemblies stabilized the dyes and enhanced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon laser irradiation. Thus, in murine tumor models, a single injection of the nanoassemblies with laser irradiation significantly inhibits tumour growth with no detectable off-target toxicity. These findings highlight the potential for improving the performance of heptamethine cyanine dyes in antitumor phototherapy through nano-enabled strategies.",,,"Reactive Oxygen Species, Humans, Animals, Mice, Carbocyanines, Photosensitizing Agents, Phototherapy, Cell Line, Tumor, Neoplasms, Antineoplastic Agents, Polymers, Nanostructures",,
38499198,Light in a Heartbeat: Bond Scission by a Single Photon above 800 nm.,"Photocages enable scientists to take full control over the activity of molecules using light as a biocompatible stimulus. Their emerging applications in photoactivated therapies call for efficient uncaging in the near-infrared (NIR) window, which represents a fundamental challenge. Here, we report synthetically accessible cyanine photocages that liberate alcohol, phenol, amine, and thiol payloads upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820 nm in aqueous media. The photocages display a unique chameleon-like behavior and operate via two distinct uncaging mechanisms: photooxidation and heterolytic bond cleavage. The latter process constitutes the first example of a direct bond scission by a single photon ever observed in cyanine dyes or at wavelengths exceeding 800 nm. Modulation of the beating rates of human cardiomyocytes that we achieved by light-actuated release of adrenergic agonist etilefrine at submicromolar concentrations and low NIR light doses (∼12 J cm<sup>-2</sup>) highlights the potential of these photocages in biology and medicine.",,,"Humans, Photons, Myocytes, Cardiac",,
38490374,Rotor-based image-guided therapy of glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM), deep in the brain, is more challenging to diagnose and treat than other tumors. Such challenges have blocked the development of high-impact therapeutic approaches that combine reliable diagnosis with targeted therapy. Herein, effective cyanine dyes (IRLy) with the near-infrared two region (NIR-II) adsorption and aggregation-induced emission (AIE) have been developed via an ""extended conjugation & molecular rotor"" strategy for multimodal imaging and phototherapy of deep orthotopic GBM. IRLy was synthesized successfully through a rational molecular rotor modification with stronger penetration, higher signal-to-noise ratio, and a high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) up to ∼60%, which can achieve efficient NIR-II photo-response. The multifunctional nanoparticles (Tf-IRLy NPs) were further fabricated to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) introducing transferrin (Tf) as a targeting ligand. Tf-IRLy NPs showed high biosafety and good tumor enrichment for GBM in vitro and in vivo, and thus enabled accurate, efficient, and less invasive NIR-II multimodal imaging and photothermal therapy. This versatile Tf-IRLy nanosystem can provide a reference for the efficient, precise and low-invasive multi-synergistic brain targeted photo-theranostics. In addition, the ""extended conjugation & molecular rotor"" strategy can be used to guide the design of other photothermal agents.",,,"Humans, Glioblastoma, Phototherapy, Neoplasms, Brain, Blood-Brain Barrier, Coloring Agents, Theranostic Nanomedicine, Nanoparticles, Cell Line, Tumor",,

The prepared dye molecules were spectroscopically characterized by NMR, FT-IR, and HR-Mass, and their thermal stability was measured by TGA, DSC, and XRD. Based on the TGA and DSC measurements, it was concluded that all the dyes are thermally stable up to 200 °C. Also, powder XRD was studied for all dyes to identify the explicit crystallinity and morphological nature of the dyes. A dye dispersion solution was prepared for the proper dyeing of modacrylic fabric and the dyed fabric showed good color strength K/S for dyes R1, R2, and R6 and fragile color strength for R3, R4,and R5. These dyes are also used for printing on substrates like paper and fabric using ink-jet printing. These dyes were also used for transferability printing applications on various fabrics.",,,,,
38413005,A Modular Approach for the Synthesis of Diverse Heterobifunctional Cyanine Dyes.,"Herein, we present a straightforward synthetic route for the design and synthesis of diverse heterobifunctional cyanine 5 dyes. We optimized the workup by harnessing the pH- and functional group-dependent solubility of the asymmetric cyanine 5 dyes. Therefore, purification through chromatography is deferred until the last synthesis step. Demonstrating successful large-scale synthesis, our modular approach prevents functional group degradation by introducing them in the last synthesis step.

38367428,Counterion influence on near-infrared-II heptamethine cyanine salts for photothermal therapy.,"Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in cancer treatment. Heptamethine cyanine dyes with near-infrared (NIR) absorption performance have been investigated for PTT. However, they are often accompanied by poor photostability, suboptimal photothermal conversion and limited therapeutic efficacy. The photophysical properties of fluorescent organic salts can be tuned through counterion pairing. However, whether the counterion can influence the photostability and photothermal properties of heptamethine cyanine salts has not been clarified. In this work, we investigated the effects of eleven counter anions on the physical and photothermal properties of NIR-II heptamethine cyanine salts with the same heptamethine cyanine cation. The anions have great impacts on the physiochemical properties of dyes in solution including aggregation, photostability and photothermal conversion efficiency. The physical tuning enables the control over the cytotoxicity and phototoxicity of the dyes. The selected salts have been demonstrated to significantly suppress 4T1 breast tumor growth with low toxicity. The findings that the counterion has great effects on the photothermal properties of cationic NIR-II heptamethine cyanine dyes will provide a reference for the preparation of improved photothermal agents through counterion pairing with possible translation to humans.",,,"Humans, Salts, Photothermal Therapy, Coloring Agents, Anions, Fluorescent Dyes, Carbocyanines",,
38355221,Ratiometric G-quadruplex/hemin DNAzymes with low-dosage associative substrates.,"G-quadruplex (G4)/hemin DNAzymes with conversion of substrates into colorimetric readouts are well recognized as convenient biocatalysis tools in sensor development. However, the previously developed colorimetric G4/hemin DNAzymes are diffusive substrate-based DNAzymes (DSBDs). The current colorimetric DSBDs have several drawbacks including high dosage (∼mM) of diffusive substrates (DSs), colorimetric product toxicity, and single colorimetric readout without tolerance to fluctuation of experimental factors and background. In addition, the usage of high-dosage DSs can smear the G4 foldings and their discard is more harmful to environment. Therefore, exploring alternative DNAzymes with potential to overcome these drawbacks of DSBDs is urgently needed. We herein developed associative substrate-based DNAzymes (ASBDs). Cyanine dyes were selected as associative substrates (ASs) due to their binding competency with G4/hemin DNAzymes. With respect to DSBDs, ASBDs needed only low dosage (∼10 μM) of ASs to be able to cause a rapid and visible substrate conversion. In addition, since cyanine dyes are NIR dyes with high extinction coefficients and their conversion products have absorption bands at shorter wavelength. Therefore, a colorimetric ratio response can be developed to follow activities of G4/hemin DNAzymes with competency to tolerate fluctuation of experimental factors and background. In particular, herein developed ASBDs can endure somewhat concentration fluctuation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. ASBDs are able to cowork with other enzymes (for example, glucose oxidase) to realize cascade sensing. The developed ASBDs can operate at low dosage of substrates with a colorimetric ratio response and can overcome the drawbacks met in DSBDs. We expect that, by designing ASs with fruitful color panel in the future, our work will inspire more interesting in developing environment-benign and low-carbon G4/hemin DNAzymes and desired colorful high-performance sensors.",,,"DNA, Catalytic, Hemin, Hydrogen Peroxide, Colorimetry, G-Quadruplexes, Coloring Agents, Biosensing Techniques",,
38322332,Tumor-targeted metabolic inhibitor prodrug labelled with cyanine dyes enhances immunoprevention of lung cancer.,"Recent progress in targeted metabolic therapy of cancer has been limited by the considerable toxicity associated with such drugs. To address this challenge, we developed a smart theranostic prodrug system that combines a fluorophore and an anticancer drug, specifically 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine (DON), using a thioketal linkage (TK). This system enables imaging, chemotherapy, photodynamic therapy, and on-demand drug release upon radiation exposure. The optimized prodrug, DON-TK-BM3, incorporating cyanine dyes as the fluorophore, displayed potent reactive oxygen species release and efficient tumor cell killing. Unlike the parent drug DON, DON-TK-BM3 exhibited no toxicity toward normal cells. Moreover, DON-TK-BM3 demonstrated high tumor accumulation and reduced side effects, including gastrointestinal toxicity, in mice. This study provides a practical strategy for designing prodrugs of metabolic inhibitors with significant toxicity stemming from their lack of tissue selectivity.",,,,,
38320291,Different Valence States of Copper Ion Delivery against Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"Different valence states of copper (Cu) ions are involved in complicated redox reactions <i>in vivo</i>, which are closely related to tumor proliferation and death pathways, such as cuproptosis and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Cu ion mediated Fenton-like reagents induced tumor cell death which presents compelling attention for the CDT of tumors. However, the superiority of different valence states of Cu ions in the antitumor effect is unknown. In this study, we investigated different valence states of Cu ions in modulating tumor cell death by Cu-chelated cyanine dye against triple-negative breast cancer. The cuprous ion (Cu<sup>+</sup>) and copper ion (Cu<sup>2+</sup>) were chelated with four nitrogen atoms of dipicolylethylenediamine-modified cyanine for the construction of Cu<sup>+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> chelated cyanine dyes (denoted as CC1 and CC2, respectively). Upon 660 nm laser irradiation, the CC1 or CC2 can generate reactive oxygen species, which could disrupt the cyanine structure, achieving the rapid release of Cu ions and initiating the Fenton-like reaction for CDT. Compared with Cu<sup>2+</sup>-based Fenton-like reagent, the CC1 with Cu<sup>+</sup> exhibited a better therapeutic outcome for the tumor due to there being no need for a reduction by glutathione and a shorter route to generate more hydroxyl radicals. Our findings suggest the precision delivery of Cu<sup>+</sup> could achieve highly efficient antitumor therapy.",,,,,
38305348,Cyclopentene ring effects in cyanine dyes: a handle to fine-tune photophysical properties.,"The aim of this study is to investigate the photophysical properties of a cyanine dye analogue by performing first-principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent-DFT. Cationic cyanine dyes are the subject of great importance due to their versatile applications and the tunability of their photophysical properties, such as by modifying their end groups and chain length. An example of this is the vinylene shift, which is experimentally known for these molecules, and it consists of a bathochromic (red) shift of approximately 100 nm of the 0-0 vibronic transition when a vinyl group is added to the polymethine chain. Our study shows that when the saturated moiety C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> of the cyclopentene ring is added to the chain, it interacts with the conjugated π-system, resulting in a smaller HOMO-LUMO gap. Here, we demonstrate the origin of this interaction and how it can be used to fine tune the absorption energies of this class of dyes.",,,,,
38271719,Polydopamine nanoplatform with near infrared light and pH dual stimuli-responsive for chemo-photothermal cancer therapy.,"Photothermal agent accompanying with thermally responsive materials, displays well controlled drug release property, which is well-received as an outstanding design strategy for simultaneous photothermal/chemotherapy in cancer. Cyanine dye, as the prestigious photothermal agent has shown great potential due to its preeminent near-infrared absorbance and excellent thermal conversion efficiency. However, their inherent defect such as inferior photothermal stability, high leakage risk and poor therapy efficacy limit their further application in cancer therapy. Hence, a facile and universal strategy to make up these deficiencies is developed. Chemotherapeutic drug DOX and cyanine dye were loaded into polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles. The PDA encapsulation dramatically improved the photothermal stability of cyanine dye. Attributed by the PDA structure feature, the thermo-sensitive small molecule glyamine (Gla) is introduced into the PDA surface to lessen leakage. The Gla can form a dense encapsulation layer on the dopamine surface through hydrogen bond. This newly fabricated Cyanine/DOX@PDA-Gla nanopaltform is characterized with NIR light/pH dual-responsive property, high NIR photothermal conversion performance and fluorescence guided chemo-photothermal therapy.",,,"Humans, Photothermal Therapy, Doxorubicin, Phototherapy, Hyperthermia, Induced, Neoplasms, Nanoparticles, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Drug Liberation, Indoles, Polymers",,
38212807,Involvement of the tumour necrosis factor receptor system in glioblastoma cell death induced by palbociclib-heptamethine cyanine dye conjugate.,"Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour in adults. The development of anti-brain cancer agents are challenged by the blood-brain barrier and the resistance conferred by the local tumour microenvironment. Heptamethine cyanine dyes (HMCDs) are a class of near-infrared fluorescence compounds that have recently emerged as promising agents for drug delivery. We conjugated palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, to an HMCD, MHI-148, and conducted drug activity analysis on primary patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines. In addition to the expected cytostatic activity, our in vitro studies revealed that palbociclib-MHI-148 conjugate resulted in an almost 100-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared to palbociclib alone. This shift of palbociclib from cytostatic to cytotoxic when conjugated to MHI-148 was due to increased DNA damage, as indicated by an increase in γH2AX foci, followed by an increased expression of key extrinsic apoptosis genes, including TP53, TNFR1, TRAIL, FADD and caspase 8. In addition, we observed a time-dependent increase in the cell surface expression of TNFR1, consistent with an observed increase in the secretion TNFα, followed by TNFR1 endocytosis at 48 h. The treatment of patient GBM cells with the palbociclib-MHI-148 conjugate prevented TNFα-induced NFκB translocation, suggesting conjugate-induced TNFR1 signalling favoured the TNFR1-mediated apoptotic response rather than the pro-inflammatory response pathway. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of endocytosis of TNFR1, and siRNA-knockdown of TNFR1 reversed the palbociclib-MHI-148-induced cell death. These results show a novel susceptibility of glioblastoma cells to TNFR1-dependent apoptosis, dependent on inhibition of canonical NFκB signalling using our previously reported palbociclib-HMCD conjugate.

38183304,How to Build Plasmon-Driven Molecular Jackhammers that Disassemble Cell Membranes and Cytoskeletons in Cancer.,"Plasmon-driven molecular machines with ultrafast motion at the femtosecond scale are effective for the treatment of cancer and other diseases. It is recently shown that cyanine dyes act as molecular jackhammers (MJH) through vibronic (vibrational and electronic mode coupling) driven activation that causes the molecule to stretch longitudinally and axially through concerted whole molecule vibrations. However, the theoretical and experimental underpinnings of these plasmon-driven motions in molecules are difficult to assess. Here the use of near-infrared (NIR) light-activated plasmons in a broad array of MJH that mechanically disassemble membranes and cytoskeletons in human melanoma A375 cells is described. The characteristics of plasmon-driven molecular mechanical disassembly of supramolecular biological structures are observed and recorded using real-time fluorescence confocal microscopy. Molecular plasmon resonances in MJH are quantified through a new experimental plasmonicity index method. This is done through the measurement of the UV-vis-NIR spectra in various solvents, and quantification of the optical response as a function of the solvent polarity. Structure-activity relationships are used to optimize the synthesis of plasmon-driven MJH, applying them to eradicate human melanoma A375 cells at low lethal concentrations of 75 nm and 80 mW cm<sup>-2</sup> of 730 nm NIR-light for 10 min.",,,"Humans, Melanoma, Coloring Agents, Fluorescence, Cell Membrane, Cytoskeleton",,

38153348,NIR-II Protein-Escaping Dyes Enable High-Contrast and Long-Term Prognosis Evaluation of Flap Transplantation.,"Real-time vascular positioning, postoperative flap monitoring, and vascular reconstruction assessment are of great importance in flap transplantation. Cyanine dyes offer the advantage of high resolution in the Near-infrared-II (NIR-II) imaging window. However, the nonspecific binding of many cyanine dyes to endogenous albumin leads to high organ accumulation and skin absorption, resulting in low-quality imaging and poor reproducibility of contrast during long-term (e.g., 7 days) postoperative monitoring. Here, a novel strategy is proposed that can be widely applied to prevent protein binding for NIR-I/II Cl-containing cyanine dyes. This strategy produces protein-escaping dyes, ensuring high fluorescence enhancement in the blood with rapid clearance and no residual fluorescence, allowing for short-term repeatable injections for vascular imaging. This strategy in the perioperative monitoring of pedicle perforator flap models in mice and rats is successfully applied. Furthermore, leveraging the universality of this strategy, multiple nonoverlapping protein-escaping probes that achieve dual-excitation (808 and 1064 nm) interference-free imaging of nerve-vessel and tumor-vessel simultaneously are designed and synthesized. These protein-escaping dyes enable long-term repeatable dual-color imaging of tumor localization, resection, and tumor-vessel reconstruction at the wound site.",,,"Mice, Rats, Animals, Fluorescent Dyes, Reproducibility of Results, Optical Imaging, Neoplasms, Albumins",,
38113452,Aptamer Conjugate-Based Ratiometric Fluorescent Probe for Precise Imaging of Therapy-Induced Cancer Senescence.,"Therapy-induced cellular senescence has been increasingly recognized as a key mechanism to promote various aspects of carcinogenesis in a nonautonomous manner. Thus, real-time imaging monitoring of cellular senescence during cancer therapy is imperative not only to further elucidate its roles in cancer progression but also to provide guidance for medical management of cancer. However, it has long been a challenging task due to the lack of effective imaging molecule tools with high specificity and accuracy toward cancer senescence. Herein, we report the rational design, synthesis, and evaluation of an aptamer conjugate-based ratiometric fluorescent probe for precise imaging of therapy-induced cancer senescence. Unlike traditional senescence imaging systems, our probe targets two senescence-associated markers at both cellular and subcellular dimensions, namely, aptamer-mediated membrane marker recognition for active cell targeting and lysosomal marker-triggered ratiometric fluorescence changes of two cyanine dyes for site-specific, high-contrast imaging. Moreover, such a two-channel fluorescence response is activated after a one-step reaction and at the same location, avoiding the diffusion-caused signal decay previously encountered in dual-marker activated probes, contributing to spatiotemporally specific imaging of therapy-induced cancer senescence in living cells and three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids.

Herein, a synthetic approach for attaching aryl substituents at the C2' position of the thio-pentamethine cyanine (TCy5) dye structure is reported for the first time. C2'-aryl substitution enables the regulation of both the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) and photoinduced electron transfer (PET) mechanisms to be regulated in the excited state. Modulation of these mechanisms allows the design of a nitroreductase-activatable TCy5 fluorophore for hypoxic tumor photodynamic therapy and fluorescence imaging.

38063074,Sensitive monitoring of NAD(P)H levels within cancer cells using mitochondria-targeted near-infrared cyanine dyes with optimized electron-withdrawing acceptors.,"A series of near-infrared fluorescent probes, labeled A to E, were developed by combining electron-rich thiophene and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene bridges with 3-quinolinium and various electron deficient groups, enabling the sensing of NAD(P)H. Probes A and B exhibit absorptions and emissions in the near-infrared range, offering advantages such as minimal interference from autofluorescence, negligible photo impairment in cells and tissues, and exceptional tissue penetration. These probes show negligible fluorescence when NADH is not present, and their absorption maxima are at 438 nm and 470 nm, respectively. In contrast, probes C-E feature absorption maxima at 450, 334 and 581 nm, respectively. Added NADH triggers the transformation of the electron-deficient 3-quinolinium units into electron-rich 1,4-dihydroquinoline units resulting in fluorescence responses which were established at 748, 730, 575, 625 and 661 for probes AH-EH, respectively, at detection limits of 0.15 μM and 0.07 μM for probes A and B, respectively. Optimized geometries based on theoretical calculations reveal non-planar geometries for probes A-E due to twisting of the 3-quinolinium and benzothiazolium units bonded to the central thiophene group, which all attain planarity upon addition of hydride resulting in absorption and fluorescence in the near-IR region for probes AH and BH in contrast to probes CH-EH which depict fluorescence in the visible range. Probe A has been successfully employed to monitor NAD(P)H levels in glycolysis and specific mitochondrial targeting. Furthermore, it has been used to assess the influence of lactate and pyruvate on the levels of NAD(P)H, to explore how hypoxia in cancer cells can elevate levels of NAD(P)H, and to visualize changes in levels of NAD(P)H under hypoxic conditions with CoCl<sub>2</sub> treatment. Additionally, probe A has facilitated the examination of the potential impact of chemotherapy drugs, namely gemcitabine, camptothecin, and cisplatin, on metabolic processes and energy generation within cancer cells by affecting NAD(P)H levels. Treatment of A549 cancer cells with these drugs has been shown to increase NAD(P)H levels, which may contribute to their anticancer effects ultimately leading to programmed cell death or apoptosis. Moreover, probe A has been successfully employed in monitoring NAD(P)H level changes in <i>D. melanogaster</i> larvae treated with cisplatin.",,,"Animals, NAD, Cisplatin, Drosophila melanogaster, Electrons, Mitochondria, Fluorescent Dyes, Pyruvic Acid, Thiophenes, Neoplasms",,

Several families of Cy5 dye-based quenchers with ring and/or side-chain modifications were designed and synthesized by introducing organic small molecules or peptides. Our results showed that steric hindrance and electrostatic interactions are more important than hydrophobicity in the interaction between the luminescent negatively charged europium-chelate-labeled peptide (Eu-probe) and the quencher molecules. The presence of substituents on the quencher indolenine rings reduces their quenching property, whereas the increased positive charge on the indolenine side chain improved the interaction between the quenchers and the luminescent compound. The designed quencher structures entirely altered the dynamics of the Eu-probe (protein-probe) for studying protein stability and interactions, as we were able to reduce the quencher concentration 100-fold. Moreover, the new quencher molecules allowed us to conduct the experiments using neutral buffer conditions, known as the peptide-probe assay. These improvements enabled us to apply the method in a one-step format for nanomolar protein-ligand interaction and protein profiling studies instead of the previously developed two-step protocol. These improvements provide a faster and simpler method with lower material consumption.",,,"Coloring Agents, Carbocyanines, Peptides, Luminescence, Fluorescent Dyes",,
38029599,Novel small molecule-based organic nanoparticles for second near-infrared photothermal tumor ablation.,"Second near-infrared (NIR-II,1000 ∼ 1700 nm) therapeutic window presents an increased tissue penetration and elevated maximal permissible exposure in the application of photothermal therapy (PTT). However, the lack of NIR-II photothermal conversion agents (PCAs) limit their further development. In this work, we rationally designed and successfully developed three novel indolium-like heptamethine cyanine dyes (NFs) by installing N,N-diethylamino on the terminal ends of a conjugated polyene backbone and replacing the middle chlorine atom with o-mercapto benzoic acid and p-mercapto benzoic acid. Notably, NF2 with stronger rotating group encapsulated in organic nanoparticles (NF2 NPs) exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE), which could come up to (61.3 %). Then we conducted serial experiments to further investigate PTT capability of NF2 NPs 4 T1 cell line and nude mice bearing 4 T1 tumor. As expected, the resulting NF2 NPs presented the excellent photothermal conversion ability and superb PTT effect both in vivo and in vitro. This study will inspire more work for future design and clinical applications of NIR-II therapeutic agents.",,,"Animals, Mice, Phototherapy, Mice, Nude, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms, Benzoic Acid, Cell Line, Tumor",,
37955533,Small Mitochondria-Targeting Fluorophore with Multifunctional Therapeutic Activities against Prostate Cancer via the HIF1α/OATPs Pathway.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is considered to be the most prevalent malignancy in males worldwide. Abiraterone is a 17α-hydroxylase/C17, 20-lyase (CYP17) inhibitor that has been approved for use in patients with prostate cancer. However, several negative aspects, such as drug resistance, toxicity, and lack of real-time monitoring of treatment responses, could appear with long-term use. Therefore, the development of anticancer agents with specific targeting to avoid side effects is imperative. Here, we used MHI-148, a type of heptamethine cyanine (HC) near-infrared fluorescence dye (NIRF), as a prototype structure to synthesize two theranostic agents, Abi-DZ-1 and Abi-783. The new compound Abi-DZ-1 retained the excellent photophysical characteristics and NIRF imaging property of MHI-148, and it could preferentially accumulate in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate epithelial cells via the HIF1α/organic anion-transporting polypeptides axis. NIRF imaging using Abi-DZ-1 selectively identified tumors in mice bearing PCa xenografts. Moreover, Abi-DZ-1 treatment significantly retarded the tumor growth in both a cell-derived xenograft model and a patient-derived tumor xenograft model. This finding demonstrated that Abi-DZ-1 may hold promise as a potential multifunctional theranostic agent for future tumor-targeted imaging and precision therapy. Constructing theranostic agents using the NIRF dye platform holds great promise in accurate therapy and intraoperative navigation.",,,"Male, Humans, Animals, Mice, Carbocyanines, Prostatic Neoplasms, Fluorescent Dyes, Organic Anion Transporters, Mitochondria, Cell Line, Tumor",,
37890436,Synchronized activating therapeutic nano-agent: Enhancement and tracing for hypoxia-induced chemotherapy.,"Prodrug is a potential regime to overcome serious adverse events and off-target effects of chemotherapy agents. Among various prodrug activators, hypoxia stands out owing to the generalizability and prominence in tumor micro-environment. However, existing hypoxia activating prodrugs generally face the limitations of stringent structural requirements, the lack of feedback and the singularity of therapeutic modality, which is imputed to the traditional paradigm that recognition groups must be located at the terminus of prodrugs. Herein, a multifunctional nano-prodrug Mal@Cy-NTR-CB has been designed. In this nano-prodrug, a self-destructive tether is introduced to break the mindset, and achieves the activation by hypoxia of chemotherapy based on Chlorambucil (CB), whose efficacy can be augmented and traced by photodynamic therapy (PDT) and fluorescence from Cyanine dyes (Cy). In addition, Maleimide (Mal) carried by the nano-shells can regulate glutathione (GSH) content, preventing <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> scavenging, so as to realize PDT sensitization. Experiments demonstrate that Mal@Cy-NTR-CB specifically responds to hypoxic tumors, and achieve synchronous activation, enhancement and feedback of chemotherapy and PDT, inhibiting the tumor growth effectively. This study broadens the design ideas of activatable prodrugs and provides the possibility of multifunctional nano-prodrugs to improve the generalization and prognosis in precision oncology.",,,"Humans, Photochemotherapy, Neoplasms, Prodrugs, Precision Medicine, Hypoxia, Cell Line, Tumor, Photosensitizing Agents, Nanoparticles, Tumor Microenvironment",,
37877362,Classification and naming of polymethine dyes used as staining agents for microscopy. A short guide for biomedical investigators.,"The scientific literature contains many accounts of application of polymethine dyes, including cyanine dyes, as imaging agents, i.e., ""biological stains,"" for microscopic investigation of biological materials. Currently, many such dyes are used as probes for living cells, i.e., ""fluorescent probes."" Polymethine dyes are defined here by two criteria. First, they possess a conjugated chain of (2n + 1) sp<sup>2</sup>-hybridized carbon atoms that connect a terminal π-electron-accepting (π-electron withdrawing) group with a terminal π-electron-donating group. Second, they have an odd number (2n + 3) of π-centers and an even number (2n + 4) of π-electrons in this chain, where n equals the number of -CR<sup>2</sup>=CR<sup>3</sup>- groups, usually vinylene groups -CH=CH-. Commercialization of diverse chemical types of many polymethine dyes has been attempted. The dyes that have achieved wide application, however, are limited in number and it is these dyes that are emphasized here. Because these polymethine dyes sometimes have been described by confusing, and sometimes confused, names, we clarify here the chemical categories and names of such dyes for the nonchemist, biomedical end user of such imaging agents. Nevertheless, the nomenclature presented here is not intended to replace the traditional ""chromophore"" categories of dyestuff chemistry, because the latter are held in place both by wide usage and by venerable authorities, such as the <i>Colour Index</i>.",,,"Microscopy, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Staining and Labeling",,
37850265,Multiplexing potential of NIR resonant and non-resonant Raman reporters for bio-imaging applications.,"Multiplexed imaging, which allows for the interrogation of multiple molecular features simultaneously, is vital for addressing numerous challenges across biomedicine. Optically unique surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoparticles (NPs) have the potential to serve as a vehicle to achieve highly multiplexed imaging in a single acquisition, which is non-destructive, quantitative, and simple to execute. When using laser excitation at 785 nm, which allows for a lower background from biological tissues, near infrared (NIR) dyes can be used as Raman reporters to provide high Raman signal intensity due to the resonance effect. This class of imaging agents are known as surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering (SERRS) NPs. Investigators have predominantly utilized two classes of Raman reporters in their nanoparticle constructs for use in biomedical applications: NIR-resonant and non-resonant Raman reporters. Herein, we investigate the multiplexing potential of five non-resonant SERS: BPE, 44DP, PTT, PODT, and BMMBP, and five NIR resonant SERRS NP flavors with heptamethine cyanine dyes: DTTC, IR-770, IR-780, IR-792, and IR-797, which have been extensively used for biomedical imaging applications. Although SERRS NPs display high Raman intensities, due to their resonance properties, we observed that non-resonant SERS NP concentrations can be quantitated by the intensity of their unique emissions with higher accuracy. Spectral unmixing of five-plex mixtures revealed that the studied non-resonant SERS NPs maintain their detection limits more robustly as compared to the NIR resonant SERRS NP flavors when introducing more components into a mixture.",,,"Spectrum Analysis, Raman, Nanoparticles, Coloring Agents, Diagnostic Imaging, Gold",,

These dyes can be adjusted in terms of absorption and emission wavelengths by modifying their chemical structures. The current issues with cyanine dyes include aggregation-induced quenching, poor photostability, and short <i>in vivo</i> circulation time. Encapsulating cyanine dyes with albumin, whether exogenous or endogenous, has been proven to be an effective strategy for improving their brightness and pharmacokinetics. In detail, the chloride-containing (Cl-containing) cyanine dyes have been found to selectively bind to albumin to achieve site-specific albumin tagging, resulting in enhanced optical properties and improved biosafety. This feature article provides an overview of the progress in the covalent binding of Cl-containing cyanine dyes with albumin, including molecular engineering methods, binding sites, and the selective binding mechanism.

While significant efforts are dedicated to designing new organic dyes with improved performance, enhancing the brightness of existing dyes holds equal importance. In this study, we present a simple supramolecular strategy to develop ultrabright cyanine-based fluorescent materials by addressing long-standing challenges associated with cyanine dyes, including undesired cis-trans photoisomerization and aggregation-caused quenching. Supra-cyanines are obtained by incorporating cyanine moieties in a cyclic peptide-based supramolecular scaffold, and exhibit high fluorescence quantum yields (up to 50 %) in both solution and in the solid state. These findings offer a versatile approach for constructing highly emissive cyanine-based supramolecular materials.",,,,,
37762255,Photonics of Some Monomethine Cyanine Dyes in Solutions and in Complexes with Biomolecules.,"In search of new probes for biomolecules, the spectral fluorescent study of four monomethine cyanine dyes (MCD), both unsymmetrical and symmetrical, has been carried out in different organic solvents, in aqueous buffer solutions, and in the presence of DNA and HSA. The complexation of MCD with biomacromolecules leads to a steep growth of the fluorescence intensity. Complexes of MCD with dsDNA and HSA of various types were modeled in silico by molecular docking. Experiments on thermal dissociation of dsDNA in the presence of MCD showed the formation of intercalative complexes of MCD with DNA. Quenching of intrinsic fluorescence of HSA by MCD occurred with rate constants much higher than the diffusion limit, that is, in dye-HSA complexes. Effective constants of MCD complexation with the biomacromolecules were estimated. MCD <b>1</b> has the best characteristics as a possible fluorescent probe for dsDNA and can serve as a sensitive and selective probe for dsDNA in the presence of HSA. Photochemical properties of MCD complexed with DNA have been also studied. An increase in the quantum yield of the triplet states of MCD in complexes with DNA has been found, which may be important for using these dyes as potential candidates in photodynamic therapy.",,,"Molecular Docking Simulation, Fluorescent Dyes, Diffusion, Photochemotherapy, Quinolines",,

37713682,Ultra-Bright Heptamethine Dye Clusters Based on a Self-Adaptive Co-Assembly Strategy for NIR-IIb Biomedical Imaging.,"Despite the wide range of applications of bright NIR-II polymethine scaffolds in biomedical imaging, their solvatochromism and aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) effects in aqueous solutions limit their inherent brightness using traditional encapsulation methods, and effective hydrophilization strategies are still scarce. Here, a new set of Flav dyes is synthesized and PEGylated, followed by manufacturing DSPE@FlavP<sub>2000</sub> nanoparticles using a self-adaptive co-assembly strategy to overcome these limitations. FlavP<sub>2000</sub> can autonomously adjust its conformation when co-assembled with DSPE-PEG<sub>2000</sub> , resulting in high-efficiency luminescence (≈44.9% fluorescence of Flav in DMSO). DSPE@FlavP<sub>2000</sub> enables NIR-IIb (>1500 nm) angiography with high signal-to-noise ratios. Notably, this co-assembly can occur in situ between FlavP<sub>2000</sub> with proteins in the living body based on a novel mechanism of brightness activation induced by disassembly (BAD), achieving consistent brightness as DSPE@FlavP<sub>2000</sub> in blood or serum. The self-adaptive co-assembly strategy can be enhanced by incorporating an IPA moiety, which dynamically binds to albumin to prolong the dye's blood circulation time. Thus, the ""enhanced"" BAD is successfully applied to long-term vascular imaging and sciatic nerve imaging. Both the self-adaptive co-assembly strategy and BAD phenomenon improve the selectivity and availability of the hydrophilization methods, paving the way for efficient biological applications of polymethine dyes.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Diagnostic Imaging, Nanoparticles, Optical Imaging",,
37693889,Multifunctional Near-Infrared Dye IR-817 Encapsulated in Albumin Nanoparticles for Enhanced Imaging and Photothermal Therapy in Melanoma.,"Near-infrared cyanine dyes have high sensitivity and spatial resolution imaging capabilities, but they also have unavoidable drawbacks such as photobleaching, low water solubility, fluorescence quenching, and toxic side effects. As an effective biologic drug carrier, albumin combines with cyanine dyes to form albumin@dye nanoparticles. These nanoparticles can alleviate the aforementioned issues and are widely used in tumor imaging and photothermal therapy. Herein, a newly synthesized near-infrared dye IR-817 was combined with bovine serum albumin (BSA) to create BSA@IR-817 nanoparticles. Through the detection of fluorescence emission and absorption, the optimal concentration and ratio of BSA and IR-817 were determined. Subsequently, dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used for the physical characterization of the BSA@IR-817 nanoparticles. Finally, in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to assess the fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapeutic potential of BSA@IR-817 nanoparticles. IR-817 was adsorbed onto the BSA carrier by covalent conjugation and supramolecular encapsulation, resulting in the formation of dispersed, homogeneous, and stable nanoparticles with a particle size range of 120-220 nm. BSA@IR-817 not only improved the poor water solubility, fluorescence quenching, and toxic side effects of IR-817 but also enhanced the absorption and fluorescence emission peaks in the near-infrared region, as well as the fluorescence in the visible spectrum. In addition, BSA@IR-817 combined with laser 808 irradiation was able to convert light energy into heat energy with temperatures exceeding 50 °C. By creating a mouse model of subcutaneous melanoma, it was discovered that the tumor inhibition rate of BSA@IR-817 was greater than 99% after laser irradiation and that it achieved nearly complete tumor ablation without causing significant toxicity. Our research, therefore, proposes the use of safe and effective photothermal nanoparticles for the imaging, diagnosis, and treatment of melanoma, and offers a promising strategy for future biomedical applications.",,,"Animals, Mice, Photothermal Therapy, Melanoma, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Optical Imaging, Coloring Agents, Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions, Excipients, Water",,

37590412,Orange/far-red hybrid voltage indicators with reduced phototoxicity enable reliable long-term imaging in neurons and cardiomyocytes.,"Hybrid voltage indicators (HVIs) are chemogenetic sensors that combines the superior photophysical properties of organic dyes and the genetic targetability of protein sensors to report transient membrane voltage changes. They exhibit boosted sensitivity in excitable cells such as neurons and cardiomyocytes. However, the voltage signals recorded during long-term imaging are severely diminished or distorted due to phototoxicity and photobleaching issues. To capture stable electrophysiological activities over a long time, we employ cyanine dyes conjugated with a cyclooctatetraene (COT) molecule as the fluorescence reporter of HVI. The resulting orange-emitting HVI-COT-Cy3 enables high-fidelity voltage imaging for up to 30 min in cultured primary neurons with a sensitivity of ~ -30% ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> per action potential (AP). It also maximally preserves the signal of individual APs in cardiomyocytes. The far-red-emitting HVI-COT-Cy5 allows two-color voltage/calcium imaging with GCaMP6s in neurons and cardiomyocytes for 15 min.

Imaging methods based on the second NIR spectral region (1,000-1,700 nm) are gaining interest within the biomedical imaging community due to minimal autofluorescence and scattering, allowing higher spatial resolution and depth sensitivity. Using a SWIR fluorescence imaging device, the properties of ICG vs. heptamethine cyanine dyes with emission >800 nm were evaluated using tissue-simulating phantoms and animal experiments. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that an increased rigidity of the heptamethine chain may increase the SWIR imaging performance due to the bathochromic shift of the emission spectrum. Fluorescence SWIR imaging of capillary plastic tubes filled with dyes was followed by experiments on healthy animals in which a time series of fluorescence hindlimb images were analyzed. Our findings suggest that higher spatial resolution can be achieved even at greater depths (>5 mm) or longer wavelengths (>1,100 nm), in both tissue phantoms and animals, opening the possibility to translate the SWIR prototype toward clinical application.",,,,,

37556116,Highly Sensitive Cyanine Dyes for Rapid Sensing of NAD(P)H in Mitochondria and First-Instar Larvae of <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>.,"We have developed two highly sensitive cyanine dyes, which we refer to as probes <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>. These dyes are capable of quick and sensitive sensing of NAD(P)H. The dyes were fabricated by connecting benzothiazolium and 2,3-dimethylnaphtho[1,2-<i>d</i>]thiazol-3-ium units to 3-quinolinium through a vinyl bond. In the absence of NAD(P)H, both probes have low fluorescence and absorption peaks at 370 and 400 nm, correspondingly. This is because of their two electron-withdrawing acceptor systems with high charge densities. However, when NAD(P)H reduces the probes' electron-withdrawing 3-quinolinium units to electron-donating 1,4-dihydroquinoline units, the probes absorb at 533 and 535 nm and fluoresce at 572 and 586 nm for <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> correspondingly.

In this work, a novel strategy for developing near infrared (NIR)-activatable Ru(II) polypyridyl-based photosensitizers (PSs) was successfully developed through the incorporation of symmetric heptamethine cyanine dyes in the metal complex via a phenanthrimidazole ligand. Owing to their strong absorption in the NIR region, the PSs could be efficiently photoactivated with highly penetrating NIR light (770 nm), leading to high photocytotoxicities towards several cancer cell lines under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Notably, our lead PS (Ru-Cyn-1), which accumulated in the mitochondria, exhibited a good photocytotoxic activity under challenging low-oxygen concentration (2 % O<sub>2</sub> ) upon NIR light irradiation conditions (770 nm), owing to a combination of type I and II PDT mechanisms.

The great majority of nucleic acid-specific probes either do not stain RNA or cannot distinguish between DNA and RNA. The versatility of polymethine dyes makes them suitable as stains for visualization, analysis, and detection of nucleic acids, proteins, and other biomolecules. We synthesized the asymmetric dicationic homodimeric monomethine cyanine dyes 1,1'-(1,3-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(4-((3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl)pyridin-1-ium) bromide (Т1) and 1,1'-(1,3-phenylenebis(methylene))bis(4-((3-methylbenzo[d]thiazol-2(3H)-ylidene)methyl)quinolin-1-ium) bromide (M1) and tested their binding specificity, spectral characteristics, membrane penetration in living and fixed cells, cellular toxicity, and stability of fluorescent emission. Mesenchymal cells have diverse phenotypes and extensive proliferation and differentiation properties. We found dyes T1 and M1 to show high photochemical stability in living mesenchymal stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP) with a strong fluorescent signal when bound to nucleic acids. We found M1 to perform better than control fluorochrome (Hoechst 33342) for in vivo DNA visualization. T1, on the other hand, stains granular cellular structures resembling ribosomes in living cells and after permeabilization of the nuclear membrane stains the nucleoli and not the chromatin in the nucleus.

37421567,Fluorescent Properties of Cyanine Dyes As a Matter of the Environment.,"In non-viscous aqueous solutions, the cyanine fluorescent dyes Cy3 and Cy5 have rather low fluorescence efficiency (the fluorescence quantum yields of Cy3 and Cy5 are 0.04 and 0.3, respectively [1, 2]) and short excited state lifetimes due to their structural features. In this work, we investigated the effect of solubility and rotational degrees of freedom on the fluorescence efficiency of Cy3 and Cy5 in several ways. We compared the fluorescence efficiencies of two cyanine dyes sCy3 and sCy5 with the introduction of a sulfonyl substituent in the aromatic ring as well as covalently bound to T10 oligonucleotides. The results show that because of the different lengths of the polymethine chains between the aromatic rings of the dyes, cis-trans-isomerization has a much greater effect on the Cy3 molecule than on the Cy5 molecule, while the effect of aggregation is also significant.",,,,,

Molecular-based near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorescence imaging can effectively recognize lesion targets to improve image contrast and increase early tumor detection compared with traditional wide-light screening endoscopy. c-Met has been determined to be overexpressed in advanced stages of CRC and is considered to be a potent tumor biomarker. Herein, based on the well-targeted inhibitory effect of Crizotinib on c-Met positive tumor cells, the dye IR808 was covalently combined with the drug molecule Crizotinib, resulting in the synthesis of a NIR fluorescent probe Crizotinib-IR808 targeting c-Met positive tumor cells. Then, water-insoluble Crizotinib-IR808 was fabricated by using bovine serum albumin (BSA) nanoparticles (NPs) with excellent biocompatibility and biosafety.

37407428,Metal-Coordination-Mediated H-Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes for Effective Photothermal Therapy.,"Integration of cyanine dyes and metal ions into one nanoplatform via metal-coordination interactions is an effective strategy to build multimodality phototheranostics. The multifunctionalities of the formed nanoscale metal-organic particles (NMOPs) have been widely explored. However, the effect of metal-coordination interaction on the aggregation behavior of cyanine dyes is rarely reported. Herein, we reported the H-aggregation behavior of cyanine dye Cy-3COOH induced by different metal ions M (Fe<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> ). Moreover, the extent of H-aggregates varied with different metal-coordination interactions. Upon NIR irradiation, H-aggregates of Cy-3COOH remarkably promoted photothermal conversion efficiency. Interestingly, we also find that H-aggregates of Cy-3COOH induced by metal ions can generate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) involving singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> ) and superoxide anion radical (O<sub>2</sub> <sup>-</sup> ⋅) upon light irradiation. In addition, the ROS efficiency varies depending on the extent of H-aggregates. Additionally, the photoinduced ROS could disassemble aggregates and decompose cyanine dye Cy-3COOH, which limits the photothermal capability of Cy-3COOH/M NPs. Therefore, the photothermal performance of Cy-3COOH/M NPs could be manipulated by the degree of H-aggregation. This would provide a new insight to develop efficient phototheranostics NMOPs for cancer treatment.",,,,,

Here, we proposed a multiplex digital polymerase chain reaction method and a low-cost device for meat adulteration detection. Using a polydimethylsiloxane microfluidic device, polymerase chain reaction reagents could be pump-free loaded into microchambers (40 × 40 chambers) automatically. Due to the independence of multiplex fluorescence channels, deoxyribonucleic acid templates extracted from different animal species could be distinguished by one test. In this paper, we designed primers and probes for four types of meat (beef, chicken, pork, and duck) and labeled each of the four fluorescent markers (hexachlorocyclohexane [HEX], 6-carboxyfluorescein [FAM], X-rhodamine [ROX], and cyanine dyes 5 [CY5]) on the probes. Specific detection and mixed detection experiments were performed on four types of meat, realizing a limit of detection of 3 copies/µL. A mixture of four different species can be detected by four independent fluorescence channels. The quantitative capability of this method is found to meet the requirements of meat adulteration detections. This method has great potential for point-of-care testing together with portable microscopy equipment.",,,"Animals, Cattle, Food Contamination, Meat, Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction, DNA Primers, Ducks",,

37290004,ON-OFF Fluorescent Cyanine Dye Based on a Benzothiophenyl Rotor Enables Selective Illumination of G-Quadruplexes in Mitochondria.,"Conventional cyanine dyes exist as ""always-on"" fluorescent probes leading to inevitable background signals which often limit their performance and scope of applications. To develop specific fluorescent probes with high sensitivity and robust OFF/ON switching for targeting G4s, we introduced aromatic heterocycles through conjugation with polymethine chains to construct a rotor-π system. Here, a universal strategy is presented to synthesize pentamethine cyanines with different aromatic heterocycle substituents on the <i>meso</i>-polymethine chain. In these probes, <b>SN-Cy5-S</b> is self-quenched in aqueous solution due to H-aggregation. The structure indicates that <b>SN-Cy5-S</b> with a flexible <i>meso</i>-benzothiophenyl rotor conjugated to the cyanine backbone matches adaptively with G-tetrad planes, enhancing π-π stacking and resulting in triggered fluorescence. This allows recognition of G-quadruplexes due to the synergy of disaggregation-induced emission (DIE) and inhibited twisted intramolecular charge-transfer effects. This combination leads to a robust lighting-up fluorescence response for c-myc G4 with superior fluorescence enhancement (98-fold), allowing for a low detection limit of 1.51 nM, which is much more sensitive than the previously reported DIE-based G4 probes (22-83.5 nM). In addition, the superior imaging properties and rapid internalization time (5 min) in mitochondria allow <b>SN-Cy5-S</b> to also have a high potential for mitochondrially targeting anti-cancer therapy.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, G-Quadruplexes, Lighting, Mitochondria",,
37284292,Aggregates of Cyanine Dyes: When Molecular Vibrations and Electrostatic Screening Make the Difference.,"Aggregates of cyanine dyes are currently investigated as promising materials for advanced electronic and photonic applications. The spectral properties of aggregates of cyanine dyes can be tuned by altering the supramolecular packing, which is affected by the length of the dye, the presence of alkyl chains, or the nature of the counterions. In this work, we present a joint experimental and theoretical study of a family of cyanine dyes forming aggregates of different types according to the length of the polymethinic chain. Linear and nonlinear optical spectra of aggregates are rationalized here in terms of an essential-state model accounting for intermolecular interactions together with the molecular polarizability and vibronic coupling. A strategy is implemented to properly account for screening effects, distinguishing between electrostatic intermolecular interactions relevant to the ground state (mean-field effect) and the interactions relevant to the excited states (excitonic effects). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to simulate nonlinear spectral properties of aggregates of symmetric dyes accounting for molecular vibrations.",,,,,
37249441,Thiophene-based organic dye with large Stokes shift and deep red emission for live cell NAD(P)H detection under varying chemical stimuli.,"We report a novel method for synthesizing red and deep red cyanine dyes with large Stokes shifts, probes A and B, for live cell NAD(P)H detection. The probes were prepared using thiophene-based organic dyes featuring a π-conjugated bridge of thiophene and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene units linking the 1-methylquinolinium acceptor and formyl acceptor, respectively. These probes display weak absorption peaks at 315 nm (A) and 334 nm (B) and negligible fluorescence in the absence of NADH. However, upon the presence of NADH, new absorption and fluorescence peaks appear at 477 nm and 619 nm for probe A and at 486 nm and 576 nm for probe B, respectively. This is due to the NADH-facilitated reduction of the 1-methylquinolinium unit into 1-methyl-1,4-dihydroquinoline, which then acts as the electron donor for the probes, leading to the formation of well-defined electron donor-acceptor dye systems. Probe A has a large Stokes shift of 144 nm, which allows for better separation between the excitation and emission spectra, reducing spectral overlap and improving the accuracy of fluorescence measurements. The probes are highly selective for NAD(P)H, water-soluble, biocompatible, and easily permeable to cells. They are also photostable and were successfully used to monitor changes in NADH concentration in live cells during glycolysis in the presence of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate, treatment of FCCP and cancer drug cisplatin, and under hypoxia triggered by CoCl<sub>2</sub>. Furthermore, the probes were able to image NAD(P)H in <i>Drosophila melanogaster</i> larvae. Notably, cisplatin treatment increased the NAD(P)H concentration in A459 cells over time. Overall, this work presents a significant advancement in the field of live cell imaging by providing a simple and cost-effective method for detecting changes in NAD(P)H concentration under varying chemical stimuli.",,,"Animals, NAD, Fluorescent Dyes, Thiophenes, Cisplatin, Drosophila melanogaster",,
37231185,A cyanine dye probe for K<sup>+</sup> detection based on DNA construction of G-quadruplex.,"Potassium ion (K<sup>+</sup>) plays an important role in the maintenance of cellular biological process for human health. Thus, the detection of K<sup>+</sup> is very important. Here, based on the interaction between thiamonomethinecyanine dye and G-quadruplex formation sequence (PW17), K<sup>+</sup> detection spectrum was characterized by UV-Vis spectrometry. The single-stranded sequence of PW17 can fold into G-quadruplex in the presence of K<sup>+</sup>. PW17 can induce a dimer-to-monomer transition of the absorption spectrum of cyanine dyes. This method shows high specificity against some other alkali cations, even at high concentrations of Na<sup>+</sup>.

37220308,Structurally Induced Chirality of an Achiral Chromophore on Self-Assembled Nanofibers: A Twist Makes It Chiral.,"The surface domains of self-assembled amphiphiles are well-organized and can perform many physical, chemical, and biological functions. Here, we present the significance of chiral surface domains of these self-assemblies in transferring chirality to achiral chromophores. These aspects are probed using l- and d-isomers of alkyl alanine amphiphiles which self-assemble in water as nanofibers, possessing a negative surface charge. When bound on these nanofibers, positively charged cyanine dyes (CY524 and CY600), each having two quinoline rings bridged by conjugated double bonds, show contrasting chiroptical features. Interestingly, CY600 displays a bisignated circular dichroic (CD) signal with mirror-image symmetry, while CY524 is CD silent. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the model cylindrical micelles (CM) derived from the two isomers exhibit surface chirality and the chromophores are buried as monomers in mirror-imaged pockets on their surfaces. The monomeric nature of template-bound chromophores and their binding reversibility are established by concentration- and temperature-dependent spectroscopies and calorimetry. On the CM, CY524 displays two equally populated conformers with opposite sense, whereas CY600 is present as two pairs of twisted conformers in each of which one is in excess, due to differences in weak dye-amphiphile hydrogen bonding interactions. Infrared and NMR spectroscopies support these findings. Reduction of electronic conjugation caused by the twist establishes the two quinoline rings as independent entities. On-resonance coupling between the transition dipoles of these units generates bisignated CD signals with mirror-image symmetry. The results presented herein provide insight on the little-known structurally induced chirality of achiral chromophores through transfer of chiral surface information.",,,,,

Their character to form assemblies or aggregates has inspired the development of various functional cyanine dye aggregates in phototherapy. This article provides a brief summary of the strategies used to prepare these cyanine dye aggregates. The reports in this concept suggest that the self-assembly of cyanine dyes can enhance their photostability, opening up new possibilities for their application in phototherapy.

37163228,Doubly Strapped Zwitterionic NIR-I and NIR-II Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Bioconjugation and Fluorescence Imaging.,"Heptamethine cyanine dyes enable deep tissue fluorescence imaging in the near infrared (NIR) window. Small molecule conjugates of the benchmark dye ZW800-1 have been tested in humans. However, long-term imaging protocols using ZW800-1 conjugates are limited by their instability, primarily because the chemically labile C4'-O-aryl linker is susceptible to cleavage by biological nucleophiles. Here, we report a modular synthetic method that produces novel doubly strapped zwitterionic heptamethine cyanine dyes, including a structural analogue of ZW800-1, with greatly enhanced dye stability. NIR-I and NIR-II versions of these doubly strapped dyes can be conjugated to proteins, including monoclonal antibodies, without causing undesired fluorophore degradation or dye stacking on the protein surface. The fluorescent antibody conjugates show excellent tumor-targeting specificity in a xenograft mouse tumor model. The enhanced stability provided by doubly strapped molecular design will enable new classes of in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging experiments with possible translation to humans.",,,"Animals, Mice, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Fluorescent Dyes, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging",,

37011608,"Photoisomerization of Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes Results in Red-Emissive Species: Implications for Near-IR, Single-Molecule, and Super-Resolution Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Imaging.","Photoisomerization kinetics of the near-infrared (NIR) fluorophore Sulfo-Cyanine7 (SCy7) was studied by a combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and transient state (TRAST) excitation modulation spectroscopy. A photoisomerized state with redshifted emission was identified, with kinetics consistent with a three-state photoisomerization model. Combining TRAST excitation modulation with spectrofluorimetry (spectral-TRAST) further confirmed an excitation-induced redshift in the emission spectrum of SCy7. We show how this red-emissive photoisomerized state contributes to the blinking kinetics in different emission bands of NIR cyanine dyes, and how it can influence single-molecule, super-resolution, as well as Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and multicolor readouts. Since this state can also be populated at moderate excitation intensities, it can also more broadly influence fluorescence readouts, also readouts not relying on high excitation conditions. However, this additional red-emissive state and its photodynamics, as identified and characterized in this work, can also be used as a strategy to push the emission of NIR cyanine dyes further into the NIR and to enhance photosensitization of nanoparticles with absorption spectra further into the NIR. Finally, we show that the photoisomerization kinetics of SCy7 and the formation of its redshifted photoisomer depend strongly on local environmental conditions, such as viscosity, polarity, and steric constraints, which suggests the use of SCy7 and other NIR cyanine dyes as environmental sensors. Such environmental information can be monitored by TRAST, in the NIR, with low autofluorescence and scattering conditions and on a broad range of samples and experimental conditions.",,,,,
36982208,Aminooxy Click Modification of a Periodate-Oxidized Immunoglobulin G: A General Approach to Antibody-Drug Conjugates with Dye-Mediated Expeditious Stoichiometry Control.,"A universal approach to the construction of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) has been developed. It relies on periodate oxidation of naturally present glycans of immunoglobulin G, followed by oxime ligation and, optionally, copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition for conjugation with a toxic payload. The introduction of highly absorbing cyanine dyes into the linker allows for facile determination of the drug-antibody ratio. We applied this methodology to the synthesis of cytotoxic conjugates of an antibody against the tumor-associated antigen PRAME with doxorubicin and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE). The resultant conjugates retained their affinity to a large extent, yet their cytotoxicity in vitro varied dramatically: while the doxorubicin-based conjugate did not produce any effect on cells, the MMAE-based one demonstrated specific activity against PRAME-expressing cancer cell lines. Importantly, the latter conjugate constitutes the first reported example of a PRAME-targeting ADC.",,,"Immunoconjugates, Immunoglobulin G, Cell Line, Tumor, Antineoplastic Agents, Doxorubicin",,
36930757,Terpyridine-Grafted Nitrogen-Terminal Endowing Cyanine with Metal-Ion-Regulated Photophysical Properties for Cancer Theranostics.,"Heptamethine cyanines (Cy7) are one of the most important dyes in bioimaging and phototherapy, but they often suffer from poor photostability or limited photothermal conversion efficiency. Here, a facile molecular engineering approach to regulating the photophysical properties of Cy7 by metal ions is demonstrated. By innovatively modifying the nitrogen with functional groups, a novel terpyridine-grafted nitrogen-terminated Cy7 scaffold (denoted as CydtPy) was synthesized and exhibited tunable photophysical properties when chelating with various metal ions (Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, etc.). In comparison with metal-ion-free PEGylated CydtPy (LET-11), Mn<sup>2+</sup>-chelated LET-11 (namely, LET-11-Mn) exhibited the increased fluorescence emission intensity, and Fe<sup>2+</sup>-chelated LET-11 (namely, LET-11-Fe) showed the enhanced photostability with ~2-fold increase in photothermal conversion efficiency. By simply switching the chelated metal ion species, LET-11-Mn or LET-11-Fe could be used for near-infrared fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, or photoacoustic imaging. Furthermore, LET-11-Fe displayed superior synergistic efficacy of photothermal therapy and chemodynamic therapy both in vitro and in vivo. This work not only provides a new strategy for regulating the photophysical properties of cyanine dyes but also establishes a versatile nanoplatform for cancer theranostics.",,,,,
36846517,Near-Unity Superradiant Emission from Delocalized Frenkel Excitons in a Two-Dimensional Supramolecular Assembly.,"We demonstrate three general effective strategies to mitigate non-radiative losses in the superradiant emission from supramolecular assemblies. We focus on J-aggregates of 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1'-diethyl-3,3'-di(4-sulfobutyl)-benzimidazolocarbocyanine (TDBC) and elucidate the nature of their nonradiative processes. We show that self-annealing at room temperature, photo-brightening, and the purification of the dye monomers all lead to substantial increases in emission quantum yields (QYs) and a concomitant lengthening of the emission lifetime, with purification of the monomers having the largest effect. We use structural and optical measurements to support a microscopic model that emphasizes the deleterious effects of a small number of impurity and defect sites that serve as non-radiative recombination centers. This understanding has yielded a room temperature molecular fluorophore in solution with an unprecedented combination of fast emissive lifetime and high QY. We obtain superradiant emission from J-aggregates of TDBC in solution at room temperature with a QY of 82% coupled with an emissive lifetime of 174 ps. This combination of high QY and fast lifetime at room temperature makes supramolecular assemblies of purified TDBC a model system for the study of fundamental superradiance phenomena. High QY J-aggregates are uniquely suited for the development of applications that require high speed and high brightness fluorophores such as devices for high speed optical communication.",,,,,

We show that this scalable CPD-NBD derivative is readily incorporated into hydrogel formulations, providing gels that can be patterned with dienophiles upon 365 nm uncaging of cyclopentadiene. Patterning is first visualized through conjugation of cyanine dyes, then biological utility is highlighted by patterning peptides to direct cellular adhesion.

More and more cyanine dyes are emerging as one of the probe tools for nucleic acid detection due to their excellent photophysical properties. Here, we discovered that the insertion of the AGRO100 sequence can specifically disrupt the twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) mechanism of the trimethine cyanine dye (<b>TCy3)</b>, resulting in a clear ""turn-on"" response. Moreover, the fluorescence enhancement of <b>TCy3</b> combined with the T-rich AGRO100 derivative is more obvious. One explanation for the interaction between dT (deoxythymidine) and positively charged <b>TCy3</b> may be that its outer layer carries the most negative charge.

36756850,General Strategy To Improve the Photon Budget of Thiol-Conjugated Cyanine Dyes.,"Maleimide-cysteine chemistry has been a routine practice for the site-specific labeling of fluorophores to proteins since the 1950s. This approach, however, cannot bring out the best photon budget of fluorophores. Here, we systematically measured the Cyanine3/5 dye conjugates via maleimide-thiol and amide linkages by counting the total emitted photons at the single-molecule level. While brightness and signal-to-noise ratios do not change significantly, dyes with thioether linkages exhibit more severe photobleaching than amide linkers. We then screened modern arylation-type bioconjugation strategies to alleviate this damage. Labeling thiols with phenyloxadiazole (POD) methyl sulfone, p-chloronitrobenzene, and fluorobenzene probes gave rise to electron-deficient aryl thioethers, effectively increasing the total emitted photons by 1.5-3 fold. Among the linkers, POD maintains labeling efficiency and specificity that are comparable to maleimide. Such an increase has proved to be universal among bulk and single-molecule assays, with or without triplet-state quenchers and oxygen scavengers, and on conformationally unrestricted or restricted cyanines. We demonstrated that cyanine-POD conjugates are general and superior fluorophores for thiol labeling in single-molecule FRET measurements of biomolecular conformational dynamics and in two-color STED nanoscopy using site-selectively labeled nanobodies. This work sheds light on the photobleaching mechanism of cyanines under single-molecule imaging while highlighting the interplay between the protein microenvironment, bioconjugation chemistry, and fluorophore photochemistry.",,,,,
36746042,"Spectral-fluorescent and photochemical study of 6,6'-di(benzoylamino)trimethine cyanine dyes in solutions as possible probes for DNA.","Spectral-fluorescent and photochemical properties of trimethine cyanine dyes T-304, T-306, and T-307, having substituents in 6,6'-positions, in various organic solvents, in aqueous buffer solutions, in the presence of surfactants and ethanol additives, and the effect on these properties of addition of DNA have been studied. Strong aggregation of the dyes in aqueous and aqueous buffer solutions has been shown. This is due to increased hydrophobicity of the dyes, which makes it difficult to use them as spectral-fluorescent probes for DNA. In the presence of DNA, trimethine cyanines partially form highly fluorescent complexes of dye monomers with the biomolecule, with slight decomposition of the initial aggregates and the formation of aggregates on DNA molecules. The formation of different types of dye-DNA complexes, i.e., intercalation and binding in the DNA grooves, was modeled by molecular docking. Dye-DNA complexes were also studied by circular dichroism spectroscopy and by thermal dissociation of DNA. To reveal selectivity of the dyes, their interaction with human serum albumin was briefly studied. The presence of moderate concentrations of nonionic surfactants does not lead to a significant decomposition of aggregates, but leads to a biphasic dependence of the fluorescence intensity on the DNA concentration. At the same time, ethanol additives (15%) lead to a more or less linear concentration dependence of the fluorescence intensity, which makes it possible to use these dyes as fluorescent probes for DNA. The effective binding constants of the dyes to DNA and the limits of DNA detection using the dyes in the presence of 15% ethanol were estimated. Photoisomerization and generation of the triplet states of T-304, T-306, and T-307 have been also studied. Along with the fluorescence growth, complexation with DNA leads to an increase in the yield of the triplet states of the dyes. This creates a prerequisite for using the dyes in targeted PDT. In the presence of DNA, the decay kinetics of the triplet states are biexponential, which indicates different types of dye complexes with DNA. The rate constants of oxygen quenching of the triplet states of the dyes bound to DNA are significantly lower than the diffusion-controlled values (taking into account the spin-statistical factor), which is explained by the shielding effect on the triplet molecules in complexes with DNA. The data obtained show that dyes T-304, T-306 and T-307, with addition of 15% ethanol, can be used as possible fluorescent probes for DNA.",,,"Humans, Fluorescent Dyes, Carbocyanines, Molecular Docking Simulation, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, DNA, Water, Ethanol, Surface-Active Agents",,
36741156,Albumin-based nanoparticle for dual-modality imaging of the lymphatic system.,"The lymphatic system is a complex network of lymphatic vessels, lymph nodes, and lymphoid organs. The current understanding of the basic mechanism and framework of the lymphatic system is relatively limited and not ideal for exploring the function of the lymphatic system, diagnosing lymphatic system diseases, and controlling tumor metastasis. Imaging modalities for evaluating lymphatic system diseases mainly include lymphatic angiography, reactive dye lymphatic angiography, radionuclide lymphatic angiography, computed tomography, and ultrasonography. However, these are insufficient for clinical diagnosis. Some novel imaging methods, such as magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission computed tomography, single-photon emission computed tomography, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography, and near-infrared imaging with agents such as cyanine dyes, can reveal lymphatic system information more accurately and in detail. We fabricated an albumin-based fluorescent probe for dual-modality imaging of the lymphatic system. A near-infrared cyanine dye, IR-780, was absorbed into bovine serum albumin (BSA), which was covalently linked to a molecule of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid to chelate gadolinium Gd3+. The fabricated IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ nanocomposite demonstrates strong fluorescence and high near-infrared absorption and can be used as a T1 contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging. <i>In vivo</i> dual-modality fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging showed that IR-780@BSA@Gd3+ rapidly returned to the heart through the lymphatic circulation after it was injected into the toe webs of mice, facilitating good lymphatic imaging.

We are excited to report full characterization of an extraordinarily stable acyclic phosphamethine cyanine dye. Nitrile substituents on the N-heterocyclic framework afford air and water stability as well as resistance to methylation and sulfuration even under forcing conditions. Cyclic voltammetry confirms a high oxidation potential of the compound and computational investigations reveal stabilized orbitals. The unusual orbital stability appears to render the normally electron-rich P<sup>I</sup> site an extremely poor nucleophile and difficult to oxidize.

36719011,Structural and optical variation of pseudoisocyanine aggregates nucleated on DNA substrates.,"Coherently coupled pseudoisocyanine (PIC) dye aggregates have demonstrated the ability to delocalize electronic excitations and ultimately migrate excitons with much higher efficiency than similar designs where excitations are isolated to individual chromophores. Here, we report initial evidence of a new type of PIC aggregate, formed through heterogeneous nucleation on DNA oligonucleotides, displaying photophysical properties that differ significantly from previously reported aggregates. This new aggregate, which we call the super aggregate (SA) due to the need for elevated dye excess to form it, is clearly differentiated from previously reported aggregates by spectroscopic and biophysical characterization. In emission spectra, the SA exhibits peak narrowing and, in some cases, significant quantum yield variation, indicative of stronger coupling in cyanine dyes. The SA was further characterized with circular dichroism and atomic force microscopy observing unique features depending on the DNA substrate. Then by integrating an AlexaFluor<sup>TM</sup>647 (AF) dye as an energy transfer acceptor into the system, we observed mixed energy transfer characteristics using the different DNA. For example, SA formed with a rigid DNA double crossover tile (DX-tile) substrate resulted in AF emission sensitization. While SA formed with more flexible non-DX-tile DNA (i.e. duplex and single strand DNA) resulted in AF emission quenching. These combined characterizations strongly imply that DNA-based PIC aggregate properties can be controlled through simple modifications to the DNA substrate's sequence and geometry. Ultimately, we aim to inform rational design principles for future device prototyping. For example, one key conclusion of the study is that the high absorbance cross-section and efficient energy transfer observed with rigid substrates made for better photonic antennae, compared to flexible DNA substrates.",,,"Quinolines, DNA, DNA, Single-Stranded, Circular Dichroism",,

However, the lack of biocompatible contrast agents with bright NIR-II emission has hindered its application in fundamental research and clinical trials. Herein, a liposome encapsulation strategy for generating ultrabright liposome-cyanine dyes by restricting dyes in the hydrophobic pockets of lipids and inhibiting the aggregation, as corroborated by computational modeling, is reported. Compared with free indocyanine green (ICG, an US Food and Drug Administration-approved cyanine dye), liposome-encapsulated ICG (S-Lipo-ICG) shows a 38.7-fold increase in NIR-II brightness and enables cerebrovascular imaging at only one-tenth dose over a long period (30 min). By adjusting the excitation wavelength, two liposome-encapsulated cyanine dyes (S-Lipo-ICG and S-Lipo-FD1080) enable NIR-II dual-color imaging.

36678875,Effect of Solubilizing Group on the Antibacterial Activity of Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizers.,"Antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria dictates the development of novel treatment modalities such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (APDT) utilizing organic dyes termed photosensitizers that exhibit a high cytotoxicity upon light irradiation. Most of the clinically approved photosensitizers are porphyrins that are poorly excitable in the therapeutic near-IR spectral range. In contrast, cyanine dyes function well in the near-IR region, but their phototoxicity, in general, is very low. The introduction of iodine atoms in the cyanine molecules was recently demonstrated to greatly increase their phototoxicity. Herein, we synthesized a series of the new iodinated heptamethine cyanine dyes (<b>ICy7</b>) containing various solubilizing moieties, i.e., negatively charged carboxylic (<b>ICy7COOH</b>) and sulfonic (<b>ICy7SO<sub>3</sub>H</b>) groups, positively charged triphenylphosphonium (<b>ICy7PPh<sub>3</sub></b>), triethylammonium (<b>ICy7NEt<sub>3</sub></b>) and amino (<b>ICy7NH<sub>2</sub></b>) groups, and neutral amide (<b>ICy7CONHPr</b>) group. The effect of these substituents on the photodynamic eradication of Gram-positive (<i>S. aureus</i>) and Gram-negative (<i>E. coli</i> and <i>P. aeruginosa</i>) pathogens was studied. Cyanine dyes containing the amide and triphenylphosphonium groups were found to be the most efficient for eradication of the investigated bacteria. These dyes are effective at low concentrations of 0.05 µM (33 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) for <i>S. aureus</i>, 50 µM (200 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) for <i>E. coli</i>, and 5 µM (100 J/cm<sup>2</sup>) for <i>P. aeruginosa</i> and considered, therefore, promising photosensitizers for APDT applications. The innovation of the new photosensitizers consisted of a combination of the heavy-atom effect that increases singlet oxygen generation with the solubilizing group's effect improving cell uptake, and with effective near-IR excitation. Such a combination helped to noticeably increase the APDT efficacy and should pave the way for the development of more advanced photosensitizers for clinical use.",,,,,
36671513,Selenium-Substituted Monomethine Cyanine Dyes as Selective G-Quadruplex Spectroscopic Probes with Theranostic Potential.,"The binding interactions of six ligands, neutral and monocationic asymmetric monomethine cyanine dyes comprising benzoselenazolyl moiety with duplex DNA and RNA and G-quadruplex structures were evaluated using fluorescence, UV/Vis (thermal melting) and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The main objective was to assess the impact of different substituents (methyl vs. sulfopropyl vs. thiopropyl/thioethyl) on the nitrogen atom of the benzothiazolyl chromophore on various nucleic acid structures. The monomethine cyanine dyes with methyl substituents showed a 100-fold selectivity for G-quadruplex versus duplex DNA. Study results indicate that cyanines bind with G-quadruplex via end π-π stacking interactions and possible additional interactions with nucleobases/phosphate backbone of grooves or loop bases. Cyanine with thioethyl substituent distinguishes duplex DNA and RNA and G-quadruplex structures by distinctly varying ICD signals. Furthermore, cell viability assay reveals the submicromolar activity of cyanines with methyl substituents against all tested human cancer cell lines. Confocal microscopy analysis shows preferential accumulation of cyanines with sulfopropyl and thioethyl substituents in mitochondria and indicates localization of cyanines with methyl in nucleus, particularly nucleolus. This confirms the potential of examined cyanines as theranostic agents, possessing both fluorescent properties and cell viability inhibitory effect.",,,"Humans, Selenium, Precision Medicine, DNA, Circular Dichroism, Fluorescent Dyes, RNA, G-Quadruplexes",,
36651281,Trans-cis isomerization kinetics of cyanine dyes reports on the folding states of exogeneous RNA G-quadruplexes in live cells.,"Guanine (G)-rich nucleic acids are prone to assemble into four-stranded structures, so-called G-quadruplexes. Abnormal GGGGCC repeat elongations, and in particular their folding states, are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia. Due to methodological constraints however, most studies of G quadruplex structures are restricted to in vitro conditions. Evidence of how GGGGCC repeats form into G-quadruplexes in vivo is sparse. We devised a readout strategy, exploiting the sensitivity of trans-cis isomerization of cyanine dyes to local viscosity and sterical constraints. Thereby, folding states of cyanine-labeled RNA, and in particular G-quadruplexes, can be identified in a sensitive manner. The isomerization kinetics, monitored via fluorescence blinking generated upon transitions between a fluorescent trans isomer and a non-fluorescent cis isomer, was first characterized for RNA with GGGGCC repeats in aqueous solution using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and transient state (TRAST) monitoring. With TRAST, monitoring the isomerization kinetics from how the average fluorescence intensity varies with laser excitation modulation characteristics, we could then detect folding states of fluorescently tagged RNA introduced into live cells.",,,"Humans, Fluorescent Dyes, Frontotemporal Dementia, G-Quadruplexes, Isomerism, RNA",,
36643871,Single-molecule characterization of a bright and photostable deep-red fluorescent squaraine-figure-eight (SF8) dye.,"Squaraine Figure Eight (SF8) dyes are a unique class of deep-red fluorescent dyes with self-threaded molecular architecture that provides structural rigidity while simultaneously encapsulating and protecting the emissive fluorochrome. Previous cell microscopy and bulk phase studies of SF8 dyes indicated order of magnitude enhancements in photostability over conventional pentamethine cyanine dyes such as Cy5. Studies conducted at the single molecule level now reveal that these ensemble level enhancements carry over to the single molecule level in terms of enhanced emission quantum yields, longer times to photobleaching, and enhanced total photon yields. When compared to Cy5, the SF8-based dye SF8(D4)<sub>2</sub> possesses a three-fold larger single molecule emission quantum yield, exhibits order of magnitude longer average times before photobleaching, and exhibits twenty times larger photon yields. Additional features such as water solubility, fluorochrome encapsulation to protect it against nucleophilic attack, and selective biomarker targeting capability make SF8-based dyes promising candidates for biological labeling and microscopy applications and single molecule tracking.",,,,,
36638265,Benchmarking Thiolate-Driven Photoswitching of Cyanine Dyes.,"Carbocyanines are among the best performing dyes in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), but their performance critically relies on optimized photoswitching buffers. Here, we study the versatile role of thiols in cyanine photoswitching at varying intensities generated in a single acquisition by a microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror placed in the excitation path. The key metrics we have analyzed as a function of the thiolate concentration are photon budget, on-state and off-state lifetimes and the corresponding impact on image resolution. We show that thiolate acts as a concentration bandpass filter for the maximum achievable resolution and determine a minimum of ∼1 mM is necessary to facilitate SMLM measurements. We also identify a concentration bandwidth of 1-16 mM in which the photoswitching performance can be balanced between high molecular brightness and high off-time to on-time ratios. Furthermore, we monitor the performance of the popular oxygen scavenger system based on glucose and glucose oxidase over time and show simple measures to avoid acidification during prolonged measurements. Finally, the impact of buffer settings is quantitatively tested on the distribution of the glucose transporter protein 4 within the plasma membrane of adipocytes. Our work provides a general strategy for achieving optimal resolution in SMLM with relevance for the development of novel buffers and dyes.",,,"Benchmarking, Fluorescent Dyes, Carbocyanines, Single Molecule Imaging, Quinolines",,
36614318,Enhanced Tumor Uptake and Retention of Cyanine Dye-Albumin Complex for Tumor-Targeted Imaging and Phototherapy.,"Heptamethine cyanine dyes are widely used for in vivo near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and NIR laser-induced cancer phototherapy due to their good optical properties. Since most of heptamethine cyanine dyes available commercially are highly hydrophobic, they can usually be used for in vivo applications after formation of complexes with blood plasma proteins, especially serum albumin, to increase aqueous solubility. The complex formation between cyanine dyes and albumin improves the chemical stability and optical property of the hydrophobic cyanine dyes, which is the bottom of their practical use. In this study, the complexes between three different heptamethine cyanine dyes, namely clinically available indocyanine green (ICG), commercially available IR-786 and zwitterionic ZW800-Cl, and bovine serum albumin (BSA), were prepared to explore the effect of cyanine dyes on their tumor uptake and retention. Among the three complexes, IR-786©BSA exhibited increased tumor accumulation with prolonged tumor retention, compared to other complexes. Moreover, IR-786 bound to BSA played an important role in tumor growth suppression due to its cytotoxicity. To achieve complete tumor ablation, the tumor targeted by IR-786©BSA was further exposed to 808 nm laser irradiation for effective photothermal cancer treatment.",,,"Humans, Cell Line, Tumor, Fluorescent Dyes, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Phototherapy, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Photosensitizing Agents",,
36591208,Trimethine Cyanine Dyes as NA-Sensitive Probes for Visualization of Cell Compartments in Fluorescence Microscopy.,"We propose symmetrical cationic trimethine cyanine dyes with β-substituents in the polymethine chain based on modified benzothiazole and benzoxazole heterocycles as probes for the detection and visualization of live and fixed cells by fluorescence microscopy. The spectral-luminescent properties of trimethine cyanines have been characterized for free dyes and in the presence of nucleic acids (NA) and globular proteins. The studied cyanines are low to moderate fluorescent when free, but in the presence of NA, they show an increase in emission intensity up to 111 times; the most pronounced emission increase was observed for the dyes <b>T-2</b> in the presence of dsDNA and <b>T-1</b> with RNA. Spectral methods showed the binding of all dyes to nucleic acids, and different interaction mechanisms have been proposed. The ability to visualize cell components of the studied dyes has been evaluated using different human cell lines (MCF-7, A2780, HeLa, and Hs27). We have shown that all dyes are cell-permeant staining nucleus components, probably RNA-rich nucleoli with background fluorescence in the cytoplasm, except for the dye <b>T-5</b>. The dye <b>T-5</b> selectively stains some structures in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 and A2780 cells associated with mitochondria or lysosomes. This effect has also been confirmed for the normal type of cell line-human foreskin fibroblasts (Hs27). The costaining of dye <b>T-5</b> with MitoTracker CMXRos Red demonstrates specificity to mitochondria at a concentration of 0.1 μM. Colocalization analysis has shown signals overlapping of dye <b>T-5</b> and MitoTracker CMXRos Red (Pearson's Coefficient value = 0.92 ± 0.04). The photostability study shows benzoxazole dyes to be up to ∼7 times more photostable than benzothiazole ones. Moreover, studied benzoxazoles are less cytotoxic at working concentrations than benzothiazoles (67% of cell viability for <b>T-4</b>, <b>T-5</b> compared to 12% for <b>T-1</b>, and ∼30% for <b>T-2</b>, <b>T-3</b> after 24 h). Therefore, the benzoxazole <b>T-4</b> dye is proposed for nucleic acid detection <i>in vitro</i> and intracellular fluorescence imaging of live and fixed cells. In contrast, the benzoxazole dye <b>T-5</b> is proposed as a good alternative to commercial dyes for mitochondria staining in the green-yellow region of the spectrum.",,,,,
36573095,Unraveling the Chemistry of <i>meso</i>-Cl Tricarbocyanine Dyes in Conjugation Reactions for the Creation of Peptide Bonds.,"Tricarbocyanine dyes have become popular tools in life sciences and medicine. Their near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence makes them ideal agents for imaging of thick specimens or <i>in vivo</i> imaging, <i>e.g.</i>, in fluorescence-guided surgery. Among other types of cyanine dyes, <i>meso</i>-Cl tricarbocyanine dyes have received a surge of interest, as it emerged that their high reactivity makes them inherently tumor-targeting. As such, significant research efforts have focused on conjugating these to functional moieties. However, the syntheses generally suffer from low yields. Hereby, we report on the reaction of <i>meso</i>-Cl dyes with a small selection of coupling reagents to give the corresponding keto-polymethines, potentially explaining low yields and the prevalence of monofunctionalized cyanine conjugates in the current state of the art of functional near-infrared dyes. We present the synthesis and isolation of the first keto-polymethine-based conjugate and present preliminary investigation in the prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145 by confocal microscopy and discuss changes to optical properties in biological media.",,,,,
36559040,Mitochondrion-Targeted NIR Therapeutic Agent Suppresses Melanoma by Inducing Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest via E2F/Cyclin/CDK Pathway.,"Malignant melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer worldwide, and earlier diagnosis and more effective therapies are required to improve prognosis. As a possible solution, near-infrared fluorescent heptamethine cyanine dyes have been shown to be useful for tumor diagnosis and treatment. Here, we synthesized a novel theranostic agent, IR-817, a multifunctional bioactive small-molecule that has near-infrared emission, targets mitochondria in cancer cells, and has selective anti-cancer effects. In in vitro experiments, IR-817 preferentially accumulated in melanoma cells through organic anion transporting polypeptide transporters but also selectively inhibited the growth of tumor cells by inducing mitochondrial-dependent intrinsic apoptosis. Mechanistically, IR-817 caused G0/G1 cell cycle arrest by targeting the E2F/Cyclin/CDK pathway. Finally, IR-817 significantly suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors in zebrafish and mice. Immunohistochemical staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that IR-817 induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation without notable side effects. Therefore, mitochondrial-targeting theranostic agent IR-817 may be promising for accurate tumor diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and safe anti-cancer treatments.",,,,,

The present methodology allows to synthesize of fluorescently labeled C5-nucleoside triphosphates with different acetylene linkers between the fluorophore and pyrimidine base in good to excellent yields under mild reaction conditions.

36459559,Discovery of BODIPY J-aggregates with absorption maxima beyond 1200 nm for biophotonics.,"Organic dyes with absorption maxima in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II; 1000 to 1700 nm) are of great interest in biophotonics. However, because of the lack of appropriate molecular scaffolds, current research in this field is limited to cyanine dyes, and developing NIR-II-absorbing organic dyes for biophotonics remains an immense challenge. Here, we rationally designed an ethenylene-bridged BODIPY scaffold featuring excellent J-aggregation capabilities and revealed that the bridging ethylene unit is crucial for intermolecular J-coupling regulation. By integrating the electron-donating groups into the scaffold, we obtained a BODIPY dye, BisBDP2, with a J-aggregate absorption maximum of around 1300 nm. BisBDP2 J-aggregates show excellent photothermal performance, including intense photoacoustic response, and a high photothermal conversion efficiency value of 63%. In vivo results demonstrate the potential of J-aggregates for photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of deep-seated tumors. This study will speed up the exploration of NIR-II-absorbing J-aggregates for future biophotonic applications.",,,,,
36430234,Molecular Tuning of IR-786 for Improved Brown Adipose Tissue Imaging.,"To overcome the limitations of brown adipose tissue (BAT) imaging with MRI and PET/CT, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has been utilized in living animals because it is highly sensitive, noninvasive, nonradioactive, and cost-effective. To date, only a few NIR fluorescent dyes for detecting BAT have been reported based on the structure-inherent targeting strategy. Among them, IR-786, a commercial cyanine dye, was used firstly for quantitative NIR imaging of BAT perfusion in 2003. Owing to the high cytotoxicity, poor water solubility, and strong nonspecific background uptake of IR-786, the chemical structure of IR-786 should be redesigned to be more hydrophilic and less toxic so that it can show more BAT-specific accumulation. Here, we developed a BAT-specific NIR dye, BF800-AM, by incorporating the tyramine linker in the original structure of IR-786. After modifying the physicochemical properties of IR-786, in vivo results showed significant uptake of the newly designed BF800-AM in the BAT with improved signal-to-background ratio. Additional in vivo studies using mouse tumor models revealed that BF800-AM targeting to BAT is independent of tumor tissues, as distinct from IR-786 showing uptake in both tissues. Therefore, BF800-AM can be used for improved noninvasive visualization of BAT mass and activity in living animals.",,,"Animals, Mice, Adipose Tissue, Brown, Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Neoplasms",,

36323652,Elucidating the cellular uptake mechanisms of heptamethine cyanine dye analogues for their use as an anticancer drug-carrier molecule for the treatment of glioblastoma.,"The development of chemotherapies for glioblastoma is hindered by their limited bioavailability and toxicity on normal brain function. To overcome these limitations, we investigated the structure-dependent activity of heptamethine cyanine dyes (HMCD), a group of tumour-specific and BBB permeable near-infrared fluorescent dyes, in both commercial (U87MG) and patient-derived GBM cell lines. HMCD analogues with strongly ionisable sulphonic acid groups were not taken up by patient-derived GBM cells, but were taken up by the U87MG cell line. HMCD uptake relies on a combination of transporter uptake through organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and endocytosis into GBM cells. The uptake of HMCDs was not affected by p-glycoprotein efflux in GBM cells. Finally, we demonstrate structure-dependent cytotoxic activity at high concentrations (EC<sub>50</sub> : 1-100 μM), likely due to mitochondrial damage-induced apoptosis. An in vivo orthotopic glioblastoma model highlights tumour-specific accumulation of our lead HMCD, MHI-148, for up to 7 days following a single intraperitoneal injection. These studies suggest that strongly ionisable groups like sulphonic acids hamper the cellular uptake of HMCDs in patient-derived GBM cell lines, highlighting cell line-specific differences in HMCD uptake. We envisage these findings will help in the design and structural modifications of HMCDs for drug-delivery applications for glioblastoma.",,,"Humans, Glioblastoma, Cell Line, Tumor, Antineoplastic Agents, Fluorescent Dyes, Brain Neoplasms",,
36323089,Three near-infrared and lysosome-targeting probes for photodynamic therapy (PDT).,"Lysosome, an organelle which contains a number of hydrolases and hydrogen ions, plays a crucial role in cellular survival and apoptosis. If selectively destroy lysosomes membrane, inner hydrolases and hydrogen ions will leak and induce cell death. In this work, three lysosome-targeting fluorescent probes (HCL 1-3, heptamethine cyanine lysosomal-targeting probe) were designed, synthesized and developed for photodynamic therapy. Piperazine and N, N-dimethyl structures made HCL 1-3 have good lysosome targeting ability while Pearson's correlation coefficients reached 0.85, 0.87 and 0.78. It can be concluded from MTT test, HCL 1-3 have high photo cytotoxicity and low dark cytotoxicity from MTT test. Calcein/PI staining assays also supported cytotoxicity of HCL 1-3 under light conditions. In vivo experiments, HCL 2 accumulated in tumor and a strong fluorescence signal was observed at 12 h post injection.

36320587,The pursuit of polymethine fluorophores with NIR-II emission and high brightness for <i>in vivo</i> applications.,"Polymethine cyanine dyes, as the most important class of organic near-infrared-II (NIR-II) fluorophores, recently received increasing attention due to their high molar extinction coefficients, intensive fluorescence brightness, and flexible wavelength tunability for fluorescent bioimaging applications. Very recently, remarkable advances have been made in the development of NIR-II polymethine fluorophores with improved optical performance, mainly including tunable fluorescence, improved brightness, improved water solubility and stability. In this review, we summarize the recent research advances in molecular tailoring design strategies of NIR-II polymethine fluorophores, and then emphasize the representative bioimaging and biosensing applications.

36288482,One-Dimensionally Conjugated Carbocyanine Dyes Isolated under Cold Gas-Phase Conditions: Electronic Spectra and Photochemistry.,"One-dimensionally conjugated carbocyanine dyes are of significant research interest, particularly for their electronic photoexcitation, owing to a wide variety of characteristics, including a good analogy to ""free electrons in a one-dimensional box"" model and <i>trans</i>-<i>cis</i> photoisomerization along the conjugated chain. Despite these important aspects, their electronic spectra remain ambiguous in terms of their assignment owing to the significant effects of their surrounding environment. In this study, we present the electronic spectra of two cyanine dyes, 1,1'-diethyl-2,2'-carbocyanine (pinacyanol, <b>1</b>) and 1,1'-diethyl-4,4'-carbocyanine (cryptocyanine, <b>2</b>), measured under cold (∼10 K) gas-phase conditions, to determine the intrinsic electronic transition energy and provide clear assignments for the spectra. The obtained visible photodissociation spectra demonstrate (1) spectral shifts in response to both solvent and temperature, (2) the contribution from the vibrational excitation in the excited state (Franck-Condon (FC) activity), and (3) the coexistence of conformers caused by the orientation of the side ethyl groups. These factors affect the electronic transition energy up to ∼1000 cm<sup>-1</sup> in total for both <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, which corresponds to an effective length of 0.5 Å in terms of the ""one-dimensional box"" model. Furthermore, a difference was observed in the effective bandwidth of the spectra between <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> based on a comparison with the simulated FC patterns around the origin band; the bandwidth was substantially larger for <b>2</b> than that of <b>1</b>, implying the shorter lifetime of <b>2</b> in the photoexcited S<sub>1</sub> state. With the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the relaxed potential energy curves, we partly ascribed this to the fast <i>trans</i>-<i>cis</i> photoisomerization via C═C bond twisting on the S<sub>1</sub> surface, followed by S<sub>1</sub>-S<sub>0</sub> internal conversion.",,,,,
36268205,Tunable Electronic Structure via DNA-Templated Heteroaggregates of Two Distinct Cyanine Dyes.,"Molecular excitons are useful for applications in light harvesting, organic optoelectronics, and nanoscale computing. Electronic energy transfer (EET) is a process central to the function of devices based on molecular excitons. Achieving EET with a high quantum efficiency is a common obstacle to excitonic devices, often owing to the lack of donor and acceptor molecules that exhibit favorable spectral overlap. EET quantum efficiencies may be substantially improved through the use of heteroaggregates-aggregates of chemically distinct dyes-rather than individual dyes as energy relay units. However, controlling the assembly of heteroaggregates remains a significant challenge. Here, we use DNA Holliday junctions to assemble homo- and heterotetramer aggregates of the prototypical cyanine dyes Cy5 and Cy5.5. In addition to permitting control over the number of dyes within an aggregate, DNA-templated assembly confers control over aggregate composition, i.e., the ratio of constituent Cy5 and Cy5.5 dyes. By varying the ratio of Cy5 and Cy5.5, we show that the most intense absorption feature of the resulting tetramer can be shifted in energy over a range of almost 200 meV (1600 cm<sup>-1</sup>). All tetramers pack in the form of H-aggregates and exhibit quenched emission and drastically reduced excited-state lifetimes compared to the monomeric dyes. We apply a purely electronic exciton theory model to describe the observed progression of the absorption spectra. This model agrees with both the measured data and a more sophisticated vibronic model of the absorption and circular dichroism spectra, indicating that Cy5 and Cy5.5 heteroaggregates are largely described by molecular exciton theory. Finally, we extend the purely electronic exciton model to describe an idealized J-aggregate based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and discuss the potential advantages of such a device over traditional FRET relays.",,,,,
36234904,Photonics of Trimethine Cyanine Dyes as Probes for Biomolecules.,"Cyanine dyes are widely used as fluorescent probes in biophysics and medical biochemistry due to their unique photophysical and photochemical properties (their photonics). This review is focused on a subclass of the most widespread and studied cyanine dyes-trimethine cyanines, which can serve as potential probes for biomolecules. The works devoted to the study of the noncovalent interaction of trimethine cyanine dyes with biomolecules and changing the properties of these dyes upon the interaction are reviewed. In addition to the spectral-fluorescent properties, elementary photochemical properties of trimethine cyanines are considered, including: photoisomerization and back isomerization of the photoisomer, generation and decay of the triplet state, and its quenching by oxygen and other quenchers. The influence of DNA and other nucleic acids, proteins, and other biomolecules on these properties is covered. The interaction of a monomer dye molecule with a biomolecule usually leads to a fluorescence growth, damping of photoisomerization (if any), and an increase in intersystem crossing to the triplet state. Sometimes aggregation of dye molecules on biomolecules is observed. Quenching of the dye triplet state in a complex with biomolecules by molecular oxygen usually occurs with a rate constant much lower than the diffusion limit with allowance for the spin-statistical factor 1/9. The practical application of trimethine cyanines in biophysics and (medical) biochemistry is also considered. In conclusion, the prospects for further studies on the cyanine dye-biomolecule system and the development of new effective dye probes (including probes of a new type) for biomolecules are discussed.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Optics and Photonics, Oxygen, Quinolines",,

36157719,Fluorescence Quenching of Xanthene Dyes during Amide Bond Formation Using DMTMM.,"Fluorophore bioconjugation to proteins, nucleic acids, and other important molecules can provide a powerful approach to sensing, imaging, and quantifying chemical and biological processes. One of the most prevalent methods for fluorophore attachment is through the formation of amide bonds, which are often facilitated by coupling agents to activate carboxylic acid moieties for subsequent nucleophilic attack by amines. 4-(4,6-Dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methyl-morpholinium chloride (DMTMM) is among the most popular of these coupling agents for bioconjugation due to its ability to facilitate amide bond formation in water. After observing quenching of 5-fluoresceinamine (5-FAM)-conjugated oligonucleotides in the presence of DMTMM, we sought to evaluate the magnitude and scope of this challenge by surveying the effect of DMTMM on a range of fluorescent dyes. A higher quenching effect was consistently observed for xanthene dyes compared to that for cyanine dyes. Further analysis of the impact of DMTMM on FAM shows that quenching occurs independently of whether the dye is free in solution or attached to an oligonucleotide or antibody. Furthermore, we found that FAM-conjugated DNA was unable to recover its fluorescence after the removal of DMTMM, and UV-vis and NMR analyses suggest the formation of new products, such as an adduct formed between FAM and the dimethoxytriazine of DMTMM. As such, DMTMM at high concentrations is not recommended for coupling reactions where targets are fluorescently labeled. This research serves as a word of caution to those utilizing xanthene-containing fluorophores in bioconjugation reactions involving DMTMM.",,,,,
36153973,Fluorogenic Dimers as Bright Switchable Probes for Enhanced Super-Resolution Imaging of Cell Membranes.,"Super-resolution fluorescence imaging based on single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) enables visualizing cellular structures with nanometric precision. However, its spatial and temporal resolution largely relies on the brightness of ON/OFF switchable fluorescent dyes. Moreover, in cell plasma membranes, the single-molecule localization is hampered by the fast lateral diffusion of membrane probes. Here, to address these two fundamental problems, we propose a concept of ON/OFF switchable probes for SMLM (points accumulation for imaging in nanoscale topography, PAINT) based on fluorogenic dimers of bright cyanine dyes. In these probes, the two cyanine units connected with a linker were modified at their extremities with low-affinity membrane anchors. Being self-quenched in water due to intramolecular dye H-aggregation, they displayed light up on reversible binding to lipid membranes. The charged group in the linker further decreased the probe affinity to the lipid membranes, thus accelerating its dynamic reversible ON/OFF switching. The concept was validated on cyanines 3 and 5. SMLM of live cells revealed that the new probes provided higher brightness and ∼10-fold slower diffusion at the cell surface, compared to reference probes Nile Red and DiD, which boosted axial localization precision >3-fold down to 31 nm. The new probe allowed unprecedented observation of nanoscale fibrous protrusions on plasma membranes of live cells with 40 s time resolution, revealing their fast dynamics. Thus, going beyond the brightness limit of single switchable dyes by cooperative dequenching in fluorogenic dimers and slowing down probe diffusion in biomembranes open the route to significant enhancement of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of live cells.",,,"Cell Membrane, Fluorescent Dyes, Lipids, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Water",,
36149045,A Selenium-Substituted Heptamethine Cyanine Photosensitizer for Near-Infrared Photodynamic Therapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively safe approach to cancer treatment without significant systemic side effects or drug resistance. However, the current PDT efficiency is unsatisfactory due to the lack of near-infrared (NIR) photosensitizers. Heptamethine cyanine (Cy7) dyes are well-known NIR fluorophores and are also used as photosensitizers. But their singlet oxygen quantum yields (Φ<sub>Δ</sub> ) are not ideal. Herein, we developed an NIR photosensitizer with a long-lived excited triplet state (τ=4.3 μs) by introducing a selenium atom into the structure of a Cy7 dye. The new NIR photosensitizer exhibits a significantly high singlet oxygen quantum yield (Φ<sub>Δ</sub> =0.11). Its good PDT effect was demonstrated in the living cells. Considering that the selenium-substituted photosensitizer has a very low dark cytotoxicity and good chemical stability, we conclude that it will have a promising future in biomedical and clinical applications.",,,"Photosensitizing Agents, Photochemotherapy, Singlet Oxygen, Selenium, Fluorescent Dyes",,
36144515,An Insight into Symmetrical Cyanine Dyes as Promising Selective Antiproliferative Agents in Caco-2 Colorectal Cancer Cells.,"Cancer remains one of the diseases with the highest worldwide incidence. Several cytotoxic approaches have been used over the years to overcome this public health threat, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and photodynamic therapy (PDT). Cyanine dyes are a class of compounds that have been extensively studied as PDT sensitisers; nevertheless, their antiproliferative potential in the absence of a light source has been scarcely explored. Herein, the synthesis of eighteen symmetric mono-, tri-, and heptamethine cyanine dyes and their evaluation as potential anticancer agents is described. The influences of the heterocyclic nature, counterion, and methine chain length on the antiproliferative effects and selectivities were analysed, and relevant structure-activity relationship data were gathered. The impact of light on the cytotoxic activity of the most promising dye was also assessed and discussed. Most of the monomethine and trimethine cyanine dyes under study demonstrated a high antiproliferative effect on human tumour cell lines of colorectal (Caco-2), breast (MCF-7), and prostate (PC-3) cancer at the initial screening (10 µM). However, concentration-viability curves showed higher potency and selectivity for the Caco-2 cell line. A monomethine cyanine dye derived from benzoxazole was the most promising compound (IC<sub>50</sub> for Caco-2 = 0.67 µM and a selectivity index of 20.9 for Caco-2 versus normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF)) and led to Caco-2 cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.

38069704,Cyanine Renaissance: Tailoring the Properties to Applications.,"In this account, we provide an overview of the applications that arose from the recently developed synthetic methodology that delivers heptamethine cyanines (Cy7) substituted at the central chain. The ability to easily introduce and manipulate various substituents in different substitution patterns along the cyanine chain enabled rational tailoring of the photophysical and photochemical properties. Exercising this control over the structure-property relationship proved to have a substantial impact in the field of cyanine dyes and was swiftly harnessed in a number of emerging applications in distinct areas, including fluorescent probes, biosensors, dye-sensitized upconversion nanoparticles, phototruncation of cyanines and photocages. While this method unlocked a number of new avenues, many synthetic challenges remain to be conquered in order to fully capitalize on the potential of cyanines, and we provide a short perspective that summarizes them at the end of this manuscript.",,,,,
36095253,An Approach to Developing Cyanines with Upconverted Photosensitive Efficiency Enhancement for Highly Efficient NIR Tumor Phototheranostics.,"Upconverted reactive oxygen species (ROS) photosensitization with one-photon excitation mode is a promising tactic to elongate the excitation wavelengths of photosensitive dyes to near-infrared (NIR) light region without the requirement of coherent high-intensity light sources. However, the photosensitization efficiencies are still finite by the unilateral improvement of excited-state intersystem crossing (ISC) via heavy-atom-effect, since the upconverted efficiency also plays a decisive role in upconverted photosensitization. Herein, a NIR light initiated one-photon upconversion heavy-atom-free small molecule system is reported. The meso-rotatable anthracene in pentamethine cyanine (Cy5) is demonstrated to enrich the populations in high vibrational-rotational energy levels and subsequently improve the hot-band absorption (HBA) efficiency. Moreover, the spin-orbit charge transfer intersystem crossing (SOCT-ISC) caused by electron donated anthracene can further amplify the triplet yield. Benefiting from the above two aspects, the <sup>1</sup> O<sub>2</sub> generation significantly increases with over 2-fold improved performance compared with heavy-atom-modified method under upconverted light excitation, which obtains efficient in vivo phototheranostic results and provides new opportunities for other applications such as photocatalysis and fine chemical synthesis.",,,"Humans, Neoplasms, Electrons, Dermatitis, Phototoxic, Coloring Agents, Anthracenes",,
36045146,Sequence-dependence of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes in 3' terminally-labeled single-stranded DNA.,"Fluorescence is an ideal tool to see and manipulate nucleic acids, and engage in their rich and complex biophysical properties. Labeling is the preferred approach to track and quantify fluorescence with nucleic acids and cyanine dyes are emblematic in this context. The fluorescent properties of cyanine dyes are known to be sequence-dependent, with purines in the immediate vicinity increasing the fluorescence intensity of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes, and the ability of nucleobases to modulate the photophysical properties of common fluorophores may influence fluorescence measurements in critical assays such as FISH, qPCR or high-throughput sequencing. In this paper, we comprehensively map the sequence-dependence of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes in 3'-fluorescently labeled single-stranded DNA by preparing the complete permutation library of the 5 consecutive nucleotides immediately adjacent to the dye, or 1024 sequences. G-rich motifs dominate the high fluorescence range, while C-rich motifs lead to significant quenching, an observation consistent with 5'-labeled systems. We also uncover GCGC patterns in the extreme top range of fluorescence, a feature specific to 3'-Cy3 and Cy5 oligonucleotides. This study represents the final piece in linking nucleotide identity to fluorescence changes for Cy3, Cy5 and fluorescein in all 3', 5', single-stranded and double-stranded DNA formats.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Single-Stranded, Fluorescent Dyes, Nucleic Acids",,
36029662,Triazole-derivatized near-infrared cyanine dyes enable local functional fluorescent imaging of ocular inflammation.,"Near-infrared (NIR) chemical fluorophores are promising tools for in-vivo imaging in real time but often succumb to rapid photodegradation. Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only NIR dye with regulatory approval for ocular imaging in humans; however, ICG, when employed for applications such as labelling immune cells, has limited sensitivity and does not allow precise detection of specific inflammatory events, for example leukocyte recruitment during uveitic flare-ups. We investigated the potential use of photostable novel triazole NIR cyanine (TNC) dyes for detecting and characterising activated T-cell activity within the eye. Three TNC dyes were evaluated for ocular cytotoxicity in-vitro using a MTT assay and optimised concentrations for intraocular detection within ex-vivo porcine eyes after topical application or intracameral injections of the dyes. TNC labelled T-cell tracking experiments and mechanistic studies were also performed in-vitro. TNC-1 and TNC-2 dyes exhibited greater fluorescence intensity than ICG at 10 μM, whereas TNC-3 was only detectable at 100 μM within the porcine eye. TNC dyes did not demonstrate any ocular cell toxicity at working concentrations of 10 μM. CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells labelled with TNC-1 or TNC-2 were detected within the porcine eye, with TNC-1 being brighter than TNC-2. Detection of TNC-1 and TNC-2 into CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells was prevented by prior incubation with dynole 34-2 (50 μM), suggesting active uptake of these dyes via dynamin-dependent processes. The present study provides evidence that TNC dyes are suitable to detect activated CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cells within the eye with potential as a diagnostic marker for ocular inflammatory diseases.",,,"Animals, Biosensing Techniques, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indocyanine Green, Inflammation, Optical Imaging, Swine, Triazoles",,
35983738,Large Stokes shift benzothiazolium cyanine dyes with improved intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) for cell imaging applications.,"Intramolecular Charge Transfer (ICT) is a crucial photophysical phenomenon that can be used to improve the Stokes' shift in fluorescent dyes. The introduction of molecular asymmetry is a promising approach to mitigate significant drawbacks of the symmetric cyanine dyes due to their narrow Stokes' shifts (Δ<i>λ</i> < 20 nm). In this feature article, we discuss recent progress towards improving the Stokes' shift (Δ<i>λ</i> > 100 nm) in benzothiazolium-based fluorophore systems <i>via</i> efficient ICT and recent discoveries related to potentially useful live cell imaging applications of these asymmetric cyanine dyes. This article explores three interesting asymmetric benzothiazolium dye designs (D-π-A, π-A and D-π-2A) in detail while discussing their optical properties. The key advantage of these probes is the synthetic tunability of the probe's photophysical properties and cellular selectivity by simply modifying the donor (D) or the acceptor (A) group in the structure. These new asymmetric ICT fluorophore systems exhibit large Stokes' shifts, high biocompatibility, wash-free staining, red to NIR emission and facile excitation with commercially available laser wavelengths.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Quinolines",,
35894773,Synthesis and study on aggregation behaviours in liquid phase of three prepared cyanine dyes.,"Here we investigate the aggregation behaviours of three prepared dyes in the liquid phase to pick out one possessing J-aggregation characteristic that is of significant interest for organic materials used in multiple bio-applications. The self-assembly of dyes usually leads to various forms of aggregates, for example, H-aggregates or J-aggregates and it is easy to distinguish bathochromic J-aggregation from hypsochromic H-aggregation using UV/vis light spectroscopy. Enlightened by the cyanine dyes that have shown a great tendency to self-associate, we designed and synthesized three cyanine dyes: Cy7-Ph, DCy7-Ph, and SN-Cy7-Ph, followed by the study of the influence of multiple factors on their aggregation behaviours, including solvent polarity, ionic strength, and temperature. Finally, we found that of the three molecules only SN-Cy7-Ph could self-assemble into J-aggregates conveniently and stably in the aqueous phase under normal conditions.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Solvents, Spectrum Analysis, Temperature",,

In sharp contrast to previously reported D-π-A dyes with alkyl amine donor (-NR<sub>2</sub>) groups (<b>1</b>), <b>3a</b> and <b>3b</b> exhibited significantly different photophysical properties and organelle selectivity. Probes <b>3a</b> and <b>3b</b> were nearly non-fluorescent in many polar and non-polar solvents but exhibited a bright red fluorescence (λ<sub>em</sub> ≈ 630-640 nm) in stained MO3.13 and NHLF with very low probe concentrations (i.e., 200 nM). Fluorescence confocal microscopy-based co-localization studies revealed excellent lysosome selectivity from the probes <b>3a</b>-<b>3b</b>, which is in sharp contrast to previously reported D-π-A type benzothiazolium dyes (<b>1</b>) with an alkyl amine donor group (-NR<sub>2</sub>) (exhibiting selectivity towards cellular mitochondria). The photostability of probe <b>3</b> was found to be dependent on the substituent (R') attached to the quaternary nitrogen atom in the cyanine dye structure. The observed donor-dependent selectivity switching phenomenon can be highly useful in designing novel organelle-targeted fluorescent probes for live-cell imaging applications.",,,"Amines, Fluorescent Dyes, Lysosomes, Mitochondria, Optical Imaging, Quinolines",,
35841661,Exploring the benefits of surface analysis techniques to develop double multilayer transfer printing of J-Aggregates cyanine dyes by integrating L-b-L and μCp processes.,"Layer-by-layer self-assembly (L-b-L assembly) makes possible to obtain polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) and one of the polyelectrolytes could be replaced by a dye molecule to obtain multilayers which may exhibit optical properties of great interest. On the other hand, μCp has become a routine technique for the preparation of micro- and nanostructured surfaces. In our development in progress of a surface engineering strategy to transfer J-Agg cyanine dyes onto surfaces by integrating L-b-L process and μCp, this contribution highlights how surface analysis imaging techniques can bring valuable information for the development of the process involving a double Multilayers Transfer Printing (MTP) with a Moiré effect. Key parameters sustaining image interpretation are difference in deposit thickness (optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy), in roughness (atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy), in charge effect (scanning electron microscopy) and the chemical contrast between unprinted and printed areas (time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry).",,,"Coloring Agents, Microscopy, Atomic Force, Microscopy, Electron, Scanning, Polyelectrolytes, Surface Properties",,
35832086,Super-stable cyanine@albumin fluorophore for enhanced NIR-II bioimaging.,"Near-infrared-II (NIR-II) dyes could be encapsulated by either exogenous or endogenous albumin to form stable complexes for deep tissue bioimaging. However, we still lack a complete understanding of the interaction mechanism of the dye@albumin complex. Studying this principle is essential to guide efficient dye synthesis and develop NIR-II probes with improved brightness, photostability, <i>etc</i>. <b>Methods:</b> Here, we screen and test the optical and chemical properties of dye@albumin fluorophores, and systematically investigate the binding sites and the relationship between dye structures and binding degree. Super-stable cyanine dye@albumin fluorophores are rationally obtained, and we also evaluate their pharmacokinetics and long-lasting NIR-II imaging abilities. <b>Results:</b> We identify several key parameters of cyanine dyes governing the supramolecular/covalent binding to albumin, including a six-membered ring with chlorine (Cl), the small size of side groups, and relatively high hydrophobicity. The tailored fluorophore (IR-780@albumin) exhibits much-improved photostability, serving as a long-lasting imaging probe for NIR-II bioimaging. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study reveals that the chloride-containing cyanine dyes with the above-screened chemical structure (e.g. IR-780) could be lodged into albumin more efficiently, producing a much more stable fluorescent probe. Our finding partly solves the photobleaching issue of clinically-available cyanine dyes, enriching the probe library for NIR-II bioimaging and imaging-guided surgery.",,,"Albumins, Fluorescent Dyes, Optical Imaging",,
35799804,Reducing the internal reorganization energy <i>via</i> symmetry controlled π-electron delocalization.,"The magnitude of the reorganization energy is closely related to the nonradiative relaxation rate, which affects the photoemission quantum efficiency, particularly for the emission with a lower energy gap toward the near IR (NIR) region. In this study, we explore the relationship between the reorganization energy and the molecular geometry, and hence the transition density by computational methods using two popular models of NIR luminescent materials: (1) linearly conjugated cyanine dyes and (2) electron donor-acceptor (D-A) composites with various degrees of charge transfer (CT) character. We find that in some cases, reorganization energies can be significantly reduced to 50% despite slight structural modifications. Detailed analyses indicate that the reflection symmetry plays an important role in linear cyanine systems. As for electron donor-acceptor systems, both the donor strength and the substitution position affect the relative magnitude of reorganization energies. If CT is dominant and creates large spatial separation between HOMO and LUMO density distributions, the reorganization energy is effectively increased due to the large electron density variation between S<sub>0</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> states. Mixing a certain degree of local excitation (LE) with CT in the S<sub>1</sub> state reduces the reorganization energy. The principles proposed in this study are also translated into various pathways of canonically equivalent π-conjugation resonances to represent intramolecular π-delocalization, the concept of which may be applicable, in a facile manner, to improve the emission efficiency especially in the NIR region.",,,,,

35745640,Design and Synthesis of a Mitochondria-Targeting Radioprotectant for Promoting Skin Wound Healing Combined with Ionizing Radiation Injury.,"Wound healing is seriously retarded when combined with ionizing radiation injury, because radiation-induced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) profoundly affect cell growth and wound healing. Mitochondria play vital roles not only as cellular energy factories but also as the main source of endogenous ROS, and in this work a mitochondria-targeting radioprotectant (CY-TMP1) is reported for radiation injury-combined wound repair. It was designed, synthesized and screened out from different conjugates between mitochondria-targeting heptamethine cyanine dyes and a peroxidation inhibitor 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyloxy (TEMPO). CY-TMP1 specifically accumulated in mitochondria, efficiently mitigated mitochondrial ROS and total intracellular ROS induced by 6 Gy of X-ray ionizing irradiation, thereby exhibiting a notable radioprotective effect. The mechanism study further demonstrated that CY-TMP1 protected mitochondria from radiation-induced injury, including maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and ATP generation, thereby reducing the ratio of cell apoptotic death. Particularly, an in vivo experiment showed that CY-TMP1 could effectively accelerate wound closure of mice after 6 Gy of whole-body ionizing radiation. Immunohistochemical staining further indicated that CY-TMP1 may improve wound repair through angiogenesis and re-epithelialization. Therefore, mitochondria-targeting ROS scavengers may present a feasible strategy to conquer refractory wound combined with radiation injury.",,,,,
35732001,Mussel-Inspired Surface Coating to Stabilize and Functionalize Supramolecular <i>J</i>-Aggregate Nanotubes Composed of Amphiphilic Cyanine Dyes.,"We report a mussel-inspired strategy of polydopamine (PDA) coating to stabilize and functionalize <i>J</i>-aggregate nanotubes (NTs) formed by supramolecular self-assembly of an amphiphilic cyanine dye called C8S3 in aqueous media. Optimization of the coating condition by changing the incubation time in a slightly basic media of dopamine with different concentrations leads to conformal wrapping of the PDA layer with controllable thickness on the surface of the NTs. Compared to noncoated pristine C8S3 NTs, these PDA-coated NTs show enhanced stability against dilution, heating, and photobleaching. Moreover, the PDA layer wrapping around the NTs serves as an adhesive for the adsorption of a variety of metal ions and electroless deposition of the metal nanoparticles. Such stabilized and functionalized NT composites may offer a robust synthetic <i>J</i>-aggregate system to mimic the structure and function of light-harvesting complexes and reaction centers in photosynthetic systems.",,,"Adhesives, Adsorption, Coloring Agents, Metal Nanoparticles, Nanotubes",,
35721281,Synthesis of a versatile mitochondria-targeting small molecule for cancer near-infrared fluorescent imaging and radio/photodynamic/photothermal synergistic therapies.,"Although as a mainstay modal for cancer treatment, the clinical effect of radiotherapy (RT) does not yet meet the need of cancer patients. Developing tumour-preferential radiosensitizers or combining RT with other treatments has been acknowledged highly necessary to enhance the efficacy of RT. The present study reported a multifunctional bioactive small-molecule (designated as IR-83) simultaneously exhibiting tumour-preferential accumulation, near-infrared imaging and radio/photodynamic/photothermal therapeutic effects. IR-83 was designed and synthesized by introducing 2-nitroimidazole as a radiosensitizer into the framework of heptamethine cyanine dyes inherently with tumour-targeting and photosensitizing effects. As results, IR-83 preferentially accumulated in tumours, suppressed tumour growth and metastasis by integrating radio/photodynamic/photothermal multimodal therapies. Mechanism studies showed that IR-83 accumulated in cancer cell mitochondria, induced excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), and generated high heat after laser irradiation. On one hand, these phenomena led to mitochondrial dysfunction and a sharp decline in oxidative phosphorylation to lessen tissue oxygen consumption. On the other hand, excessive ROS in mitochondria destroyed the balance of antioxidants and oxidative stress balance by down-regulating the intracellular antioxidant system, and subsequently sensitized ionizing radiation-generated irreversible DNA double-strand breaks. Therefore, this study presented a promising radiosensitizer and a new alternative strategy to enhance RT efficacy via mitochondria-targeting multimodal synergistic treatment.",,,,,
38322783,Structure-Activity Studies of Nitroreductase-Responsive Near-Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Fluorescent Probes.,"Two new classes of near-infrared molecular probes were prepared and shown to exhibit ""turn on"" fluorescence when cleaved by the nitroreductase enzyme, a well-known biomarker of cell hypoxia. The fluorescent probes are heptamethine cyanine dyes with a central 4'-carboxylic ester group on the heptamethine chain that is converted by a self-immolative fragmentation mechanism to a 4'-caboxylate group that greatly enhances the fluorescence brightness. Each compound was prepared by ring opening of a Zincke salt. The chemical structures have either terminal benzoindolinenes or propargyloxy auxochromes, which provide favorable red-shifted absorption/emission wavelengths and a hyperchromic effect that enhances the photon output when excited by 808 nm light. A fluorescent probe with terminal propargyloxy-indolenines exhibited less self-aggregation and was rapidly activated by nitroreductase with large ""turn on"" fluorescence; thus, it is the preferred choice for translation towards in vivo applications.",,,,,
35652504,"Tailoring Multifunctional Small Molecular Photosensitizers to In Vivo Self-Assemble with Albumin to Boost Tumor-Preferential Accumulation, NIR Imaging, and Photodynamic/Photothermal/Immunotherapy.","Cancer immunotherapy has great potential in tumor eradication and metastasis suppression. However, systemic administration of immune adjuvants and inadequate specificity in cancer treatment, lead to restricted therapeutic benefits and potential immune-related side effects in clinical settings. In this report, the synthesis of various lengths of heptamethine cyanine small molecules to act as multifunctional photosensitizers (PS) for tumor-specific accumulation, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent imaging, and photodynamic/photothermal/immunotherapy is optimized. In particular, it is demonstrated that C8, which contains eight carbons on two N-alkyl side chains, efficiently self-assembles with albumin to form nanosized dye-albumin complexes. This feature facilitates C8 in vivo self-assembly to remarkably improve its water-solubility, NIR fluorescent emission, long-term blood circulation, as well as tumor-specific accumulation. More importantly, C8 not only exhibits a superior phototherapeutic effect on primary tumors, but also elicits secretion of damage associated molecular patterns, cytokine secretion, dendritic cell maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes activation, ultimately triggering a sufficient antitumor immune response to suppress growths of distant and metastatic tumors. Hence, this multifunctional small molecular PS is characterized with excellent tumor-preferential accumulation, imaging-guided laser irradiation, and phototherapy-induced in situ antitumor immune response, providing a prospective future of its use in tumor-targeting immunotherapy.",,,"Albumins, Cell Line, Tumor, Coloring Agents, Humans, Immunotherapy, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms, Photosensitizing Agents, Phototherapy, Prospective Studies",,

Polymethine cyanine dyes as important building blocks are frequently used to design NIR-II light-activated fluorophores. However, applications of these fluorophores were restricted by their poor photostability. Herein, we synthesized a NIR-II heptamethine cyanine dye 4 as the model compound to investigate its photostability and identify its photoproducts. Compound 4 shows improved photostability compared to ICG, and remains relatively stable even under sunlight irradiation. The cyanine scaffold's good photostability promoted its stable photothermal properties. The effective photothermal activity of cyanine dye 4 and the low toxicity of its one major photoproduct demonstrated its potential for further photo-therapeutic applications.

Toward addressing these limitations, we have combined the use of proapoptotic peptides, trimethine cyanine dye, and folate to target the mitochondria of tumor cells. A series of proapoptotic peptides and their conjugates with a cyanine dye and/or folate were synthesized in the solid phase, and their toxicity in different human cell lines was assessed. Cyanine-bearing conjugates were found to be up to 100-fold more cytotoxic than the parent peptides and to localize in mitochondria. However, the addition of a folate motif did not enhance the potency or selectivity of the resulting conjugates toward tumor cells that overexpress folate receptor α. Furthermore, while dual-labeled constructs were also found to localize within the target organelle, they were not generally selective towards folate receptor α-positive cell lines in vitro.",,,"Chemical Phenomena, Folate Receptor 1, Folic Acid, Humans, Peptides, Quinolines",,

Intrinsically, facultative anaerobic Salmonella VNP20009 target the tumor hypoxic areas, invade into tumor cells and exhibit an immune effect. Here we engineer the bacteria by decorating their surface with newly synthesized heptamethine cyanine dyes NHS-N782 and JQ-1 derivatives to obtain the biohybrid agent N-V-J, leading to the deep tumor targeted photothermal therapy and magnified immunotherapy. Due to the mitochondrial targeting capacity of NHS-N782, N-V-J becomes susceptive to the temperature rise when reaching tumors. This synergistic strategy promotes the systemic immunity by creating an inflamed ""hot"" tumor state from three different dimensions, which include the inherent immunogenicity of bacteria, the near-infrared laser triggered tumor antigens and the downregulation of PD-L1 expression.

35606352,A genetic engineering strategy for editing near-infrared-II fluorophores.,"The second near-infrared (NIR-II) window is a fundamental modality for deep-tissue in vivo imaging. However, it is challenging to synthesize NIR-II probes with high quantum yields (QYs), good biocompatibility, satisfactory pharmacokinetics, and tunable biological properties. Conventional long-wavelength probes, such as inorganic probes (which often contain heavy metal atoms in their scaffolds) and organic dyes (which contain large π-conjugated groups), exhibit poor biosafety, low QYs, and/or uncontrollable pharmacokinetic properties. Herein, we present a bioengineering strategy that can replace the conventional chemical synthesis methods for generating NIR-II contrast agents. We use a genetic engineering technique to obtain a series of albumin fragments and recombinant proteins containing one or multiple domains that form covalent bonds with chloro-containing cyanine dyes. These albumin variants protect the inserted dyes and remarkably enhance their brightness. The albumin variants can also be genetically edited to develop size-tunable complexes with precisely tailored pharmacokinetics. The proteins can also be conjugated to biofunctional molecules without impacting the complexed dyes.

Herein, we repurpose cyanine dyes into photocages that are available on a multigram scale in three steps and efficiently release carboxylic acids in aqueous media upon irradiation with NIR light up to 820 nm. The photouncaging process is examined using several techniques, providing evidence that it proceeds via photooxidative pathway. We demonstrate the practical utility in live HeLa cells by delivery and release of the carboxylic acid cargo, that was otherwise not uptaken by cells in its free form.

Numerous DNA sensors have been developed to evaluate the extent of nuclease activity but their DNA termini are not protected against other nucleases, hampering accurate quantification. Here we developed a new fluorescence enhancement (FE)-based method as an enzyme-specific DNA biosensor with nuclease-protection by three functional units (an AP-site, Cy3 and termini that are protected from exonucleolytic cleavage). A robust FE signal arises from the fluorescent <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> isomerization of a cyanine dye (<i>e.g.</i>, Cy3) upon the enzyme-triggered structural change from double-stranded (ds)DNA to single-stranded (ss)DNA that carries Cy3.

35417170,Supramolecular Mitigation of the Cyanine Limit Problem.,"Currently, there is a substantial research effort to develop near-infrared fluorescent polymethine cyanine dyes for biological imaging and sensing. In water, cyanine dyes with extended conjugation are known to cross over the ""cyanine limit"" and undergo a symmetry breaking Peierls transition that favors an unsymmetric distribution of π-electron density and produces a broad absorption profile and low fluorescence brightness. This study shows how supramolecular encapsulation of a newly designed series of cationic, cyanine dyes by cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) can be used to alter the π-electron distribution within the cyanine chromophore. For two sets of dyes, supramolecular location of the surrounding CB7 over the center of the dye favors a nonpolar ground state, with a symmetric π-electron distribution that produces a sharpened absorption band with enhanced fluorescence brightness. The opposite supramolecular effect (i.e., broadened absorption and partially quenched fluorescence) is observed with a third set of dyes because the surrounding CB7 is located at one end of the encapsulated cyanine chromophore. From the perspective of enhanced near-infrared bioimaging and sensing in water, the results show how that the principles of host/guest chemistry can be employed to mitigate the ""cyanine limit"" problem.",,,"Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Quinolines, Water",,
35415341,Synthesis of Substituted Cy5 Phosphoramidite Derivatives and Their Incorporation into Oligonucleotides Using Automated DNA Synthesis.,"Cyanine dyes represent a family of organic fluorophores with widespread utility in biological-based applications ranging from real-time PCR probes to protein labeling. One burgeoning use currently being explored with indodicarbocyanine (Cy5) in particular is that of accessing exciton delocalization in designer DNA dye aggregate structures for potential development of light-harvesting devices and room-temperature quantum computers. Tuning the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of Cy5 dyes in such DNA structures should influence the strength of their excitonic coupling; however, the requisite commercial Cy5 derivatives available for direct incorporation into DNA are nonexistent. Here, we prepare a series of Cy5 derivatives that possess different 5,5'-substituents and detail their incorporation into a set of DNA sequences. In addition to varying dye hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity, the 5,5'-substituents, including hexyloxy, triethyleneglycol monomethyl ether, <i>tert</i>-butyl, and chloro groups were chosen so as to vary the inherent electron-donating/withdrawing character while also tuning their resulting absorption and emission properties. Following the synthesis of parent dyes, one of their pendant alkyl chains was functionalized with a monomethoxytrityl protective group with the remaining hydroxyl-terminated <i>N</i>-propyl linker permitting rapid, same-day phosphoramidite conversion and direct internal DNA incorporation into nascent oligonucleotides with moderate to good yields using a 1 μmole scale automated DNA synthesis. Labeled sequences were cleaved from the controlled pore glass matrix, purified by HPLC, and their photophysical properties were characterized.

35359180,Recent advances in bioprobes and biolabels based on cyanine dyes.,"As a functional dye, cyanine dye promotes the widespread application of bioprobes in the fields of medicine, genetics and environment, owing to its advantages of good photophysical properties, excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity to biological systems. Nowadays, it is mainly used in the fields of life sciences such as fluorescent labeling of biological macromolecules, disease diagnosis, immunoassay and DNA detection, all of which lie at the core of this review. First, we briefly introduced the characteristics and principles of the cyanine dye bioprobe. Afterward, we paid attention to the recent progress of cyanine dye bioprobes widely used in the 10 years from 2010 to 2020. The application of cyanine dyes as bioprobes with different identification elements, including enzymes, organelles, immunity and DNAs, was mainly summarized. Finally, this review gave an outlook on the future development trend of cyanine dye bioprobes.

35344895,Indomethacin-based near-infrared photosensitizer for targeted photodynamic cancer therapy.,"Near-IR fluorescent sensitizers based on heptamethine cyanine (Cy820 and Cy820-IMC) were synthesized and their abilities to target and abolish tumor cells via photodynamic therapy (PDT) were explored. Some hepthamethine cyanine dyes can be transported into cancer cells via the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). In this study, we aimed to enhance the target ability of the sensitizer by conjugation Cy820 with indomethacin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), to obtain Cy820-IMC that aimed to target cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) which overexpresses in cancer cells. The results showed that Cy820-IMC internalized the cancer cells faster than Cy820 which was verified to be related to COX-2 level and OATPs. Based on PDT experiments, Cy820-IMC has higher photocytotoxicity index than Cy820, >7.13 and 4.90, respectively, implying that Cy820-IMC showed better PDT property than Cy820. However, Cy820 exhibits slightly higher normal-to-cancer cell toxicity ratio than Cy820-IMC, 6.58 and 3.63, respectively. Overall, Cy820-IMC has superior cancer targetability and enhanced photocytoxicity. These characteristics can be further improved towards clinically approved sensitizers for PDT.",,,"Humans, Indomethacin, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents",,
35332893,Liposomal cyanine dyes with enhanced nonradiative transition for the synergistic phototherapy of tumors.,"Organic photosensitizers are of great interest in cancer diagnosis and treatments such as fluorescence imaging, photodynamic therapy (PDT), and photothermal therapy (PTT). However, their poor aqueous solubility, inadequate photostability and unsatisfactory photophysical parameters limit their clinical application. Herein, we report the construction of liposome encapsulating cyanine dye Cypate (Lipo-Cy) with enhanced nonradiative transition for efficient cancer therapy. After being loaded in liposomes, Cypate molecules are spatially confined within the hydrophobic lipid bilayer, thereby causing much better stability, higher photothermal conversion efficiency, and increased singlet oxygen quantum yield than free Cypate <i>via</i> enhanced nonradiative transition through π-π aggregation. Lipo-Cy further enhanced the cellular uptake of Cypate, as well as preferable tumor accumulation and retention, leading to abundant intracellular singlet oxygen and potent hyperthermia at the tumor for effective PTT synergized PDT, even at dosages 10 times less than free Cypate. The Lipo-Cy exhibited superior anticancer efficiency, showing great prospects for clinical translation.",,,"Coloring Agents, Humans, Hyperthermia, Induced, Liposomes, Neoplasms, Phototherapy, Singlet Oxygen",,
35319215,Tuning between Quenching and Energy Transfer in DNA-Templated Heterodimer Aggregates.,"Molecular excitons, which propagate spatially via electronic energy transfer, are central to numerous applications including light harvesting, organic optoelectronics, and nanoscale computing; they may also benefit applications such as photothermal therapy and photoacoustic imaging through the local generation of heat via rapid excited-state quenching. Here we show how to tune between energy transfer and quenching for heterodimers of the same pair of cyanine dyes by altering their spatial configuration on a DNA template. We assemble ""transverse"" and ""adjacent"" heterodimers of Cy5 and Cy5.5 using DNA Holliday junctions. We find that the transverse heterodimers exhibit optical properties consistent with excitonically interacting dyes and fluorescence quenching, while the adjacent heterodimers exhibit optical properties consistent with nonexcitonically interacting dyes and disproportionately large Cy5.5 emission, suggestive of energy transfer between dyes. We use transient absorption spectroscopy to show that quenching in the transverse heterodimer occurs via rapid nonradiative decay to the ground state (∼31 ps) and that in the adjacent heterodimer rapid energy transfer from Cy5 to Cy5.5 (∼420 fs) is followed by Cy5.5 excited-state relaxation (∼700 ps). Accessing such drastically different photophysics, which may be tuned on demand for different target applications, highlights the utility of DNA as a template for dye aggregation.",,,"DNA, DNA Replication, Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Spectrum Analysis",,
35264603,Effect of morpholine and charge distribution of cyanine dyes on cell internalization and cytotoxicity.,"To improve the potency of Heptamethine cyanines (Hcyanines) in cancer research, we designed and synthesized two novel Hcyanines based theranostic probes, IR794-Morph and IR794-Morph-Mpip, to enhance cancer cell internalization and targeting. In acidic conditions that resemble to tumour environment, both IR794 derivatives exhibited broad NIR absorption band (704‒794 nm) and fluorescence emission (798‒828 nm) that is suitable for deep seated tumour imaging. Moreover, in vitro study revealed that IR794-Morph-Mpip exhibited better cancer targetability towards various cancer cell lines under physiological and slightly acidic conditions compared to normal cells. IR794-Morph-Mpip was fast internalized into the cancer cells within the first 5 min and mostly localized in lysosomes and mitochondria. In addition, the internalized signal was brighter when the cells were in the hypoxic environment. Furthermore, cellular uptake mechanism of both IR794 dyes, investigated via flow cytometry, revealed that endocytosis through OATPs receptors and clathrin-mediated endocytosis were the main routes. Moreover, IR794-Morph-Mpip, displayed anti-cancer activity towards all tested cancer cell types with IC<sub>50</sub> below 7 μM (at 6 h incubation), which is approximately three times lower than that of the normal cells. Therefore, increasing protonated cites in tumour environment of Hcyanines together with incorporating morpholine in the molecule can enhance structure-inherent targeting of these dyes.",,,"Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Morpholines, Neoplasms, Quinolines",,

In this paper, the effect of the host-guest interaction between cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) and a model trimethine indocyanine (Cy3) on dye spectral properties and aggregation in water is investigated. Solution studies, performed by a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques, indicate that the addition of CB[8] disrupts Cy3 aggregates, leading to the formation of a 1 : 1 host-guest complex with an association constant of 1.5×10<sup>6</sup>  M<sup>-1</sup> .

35129190,Rational design of a large Stokes shift xanthene-benzothiozolium dyad for probing cysteine in mitochondria.,"Xanthene-modified cyanine dyes are considered to be an effective means to extend the emission wavelength and improve the photo-stability of cyanine dyes. However, the fluorophores obtained by this strategy generally have narrow Stokes shifts, which severely limits their application in biological imaging. Herein, a reasonable design strategy is adopted to provide an effective strategy to commendably improve the Stokes shift of xanthene-benzothiozolium fluorophores <i>via</i> the simultaneous expansion of a molecular π-conjugated system and heteroatomic substitution. Combined with density functional theory calculation guidance, the O atom is replaced with the S atom in the xanthene moiety and a π-conjugated benzene ring is introduced in the benzothiozolium moiety. Surprisingly, the results of the spectroscopic experiment showed that the fluorescence emission wavelength of PhCy-OH was extended to 803 nm, and the Stokes shift was improved to 68 nm. PhCy-Cys can effectively distinguish Cys from homocysteine (Hcy) and glutathione (GSH) with an extremely low detection limit of 0.166 μM. Importantly, PhCy-Cys has the ability to image endogenous Cys in mitochondria, providing the potential for exploring the specific function and mechanism of Cys in regulating oxidative stress in mitochondria.",,,"Benzopyrans, Cysteine, Fluorescent Dyes, Glutathione, Mitochondria, Xanthenes",,

I-IR799 is a heptamethine cyanine derivative that can be activated by near-infrared light for photodynamic therapy (PDT) purposes. I-IR799-CXB and I-IR799-IMC were tested for their cancer-targeting capacity and photodynamic efficiency toward hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells relative to normal liver cells, alpha mouse liver 12 (AML12) cells.

35103979,Polymethine dyes for PDT: recent advances and perspectives to drive future applications.,"It has been proved that the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is closely related to the intrinsic features of the photosensitizer (PS). Over the recent years, several efforts have been devoted to the discovery of novel and more efficient photosensitizers showing higher efficacy and lower side effects. In this context, squaraine and cyanine dyes have been reported to potentially overcome the drawbacks related to the traditional PSs. In fact, squaraines and cyanines are characterized by sharp and intense absorption bands and narrow emission bands with high extinction coefficients typically in the red and near-infrared region, good photo and thermal stability and a strong fluorescent emission in organic solvents. In addition, biocompatibility and low toxicity make them suitable for biological applications. Despite these interesting intrinsic features, their chemical instability and self-aggregation properties in biological media still limit their use in PDT. To overcome these drawbacks, the self-assembly and incorporation into smart nanoparticle systems are forwarded promising approaches that can control their physicochemical properties, providing rational solutions for the limitation of free dye administration in the PDT application. The present review summarizes the latest advances in squaraine and cyanine dyes for PDT application, analyzing the different strategies, i.e.the self-assembly and the incorporation into nanoparticles, to further enhance their photochemical properties and therapeutic potential. The in vivo assessments are still limited, thus further delaying their effective application in PDT.",,,"Coloring Agents, Indoles, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents",,

In particular, we employ a protocol for the construction of compact and accurate multideterminant Jastrow-Slater wave functions for multiple states, which we have recently validated on the excited-state properties of several small prototypical molecules. Here, we obtain quantum Monte Carlo excitation energies in excellent agreement with high-level coupled cluster for all the cyanines where the coupled cluster method is applicable. Furthermore, we push our protocol to longer chains, demonstrating that quantum Monte Carlo is a viable methodology to establish reference data at system sizes which are hard to reach with other high-end approaches of similar accuracy. Finally, we determine which ingredients are key to an accurate treatment of these challenging systems and rationalize why a description of the excitation based on only active π orbitals lacks the desired accuracy for the shorter chains.",,,,,
35080842,"""Invisible"" Digital Light Processing 3D Printing with Near Infrared Light.","The ability to 3D print structures with low-intensity, long-wavelength light will broaden the materials scope to facilitate inclusion of biological components and nanoparticles. Current materials limitations arise from the pervasive absorption, scattering, and/or degradation that occurs upon exposure to high-intensity, short-wavelength (ultraviolet) light, which is the present-day standard used in light-based 3D printers. State-of-the-art techniques have recently extended printability to orange/red light. However, as the wavelength of light increases, so do the inherent challenges to match the speed and resolution of traditional UV light-induced solidification processes (i.e., photocuring). Herein, a photosystem is demonstrated to enable low-intensity (<5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>), long-wavelength (∼850 nm) near-infrared (NIR) light-driven 3D printing, ""invisible"" to the human eye. The combination of a NIR absorbing cyanine dye with electron-rich and -deficient redox pairs was required for rapid photocuring in a catalytic manner. The rate of polymerization and time to solidification upon exposure to NIR light were characterized via in situ spectroscopic and rheological monitoring. Translation to NIR digital light processing (projection-based) 3D printing was accomplished through rigorous optimization of resin composition and printing parameters to balance the speed (<60 s/layer) and resolution (<300 μm features). As a proof-of-concept, composite 3D printing with nanoparticle-infused resins was accomplished. Preliminary analysis showed improved feature fidelity for structures produced with NIR relative to UV light. The present report provides key insight that will inform next-generation light-based photocuring technology, such as wavelength-selective multimaterial 3D bio- and composite-printing.",,,,,
35028505,Counterion-insulated near-infrared dyes in biodegradable polymer nanoparticles for <i>in vivo</i> imaging.,"Polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are highly attractive for biomedical applications due to their potential biodegradability and capacity to encapsulate different loads, notably drugs and contrast agents. For <i>in vivo</i> optical bioimaging, NPs should operate in the near-infrared region (NIR) and exhibit stealth properties. In the present work, we applied the approach of ionic dye insulation with bulky hydrophobic counterions for encapsulation of near-infrared cyanine dyes (Cy5.5 and Cy7 bearing two octadecyl chains) into biodegradable polymer (PLGA) NPs. We found that at high dye loading (20-50 mM with respect to the polymer), the bulkiest fluorinated tetraphenylborate counterion minimized best the aggregation-caused quenching and improved fluorescence quantum yields of both NIR dyes, especially of Cy5.5. In addition, bulky counterions also enabled formation of small 40 nm polymeric NPs in contrast to smaller counterions. To provide them stealth properties, we prepared 40 nm dye-loaded PEGylated NPs through nanoprecipitation of synthetic PLGA-PEG block copolymer with the dye/counterion salt. The obtained NIR NPs loaded with Cy5.5 dye salt allowed <i>in vivo</i> imaging of wild-type mice with a good contrast after IV injection. Compared to the bare PLGA NPs, PLGA-PEG NPs exhibited significantly slower accumulation in the liver. Biodistribution studies confirmed the preferential accumulation in the liver, although PLGA and PLGA-PEG NPs could also be distributed in other organs, with the following tendency: liver > spleen > lungs > kidney > heart > testis > brain. Overall, the present work validated the counterion approach for encapsulation of NIR cyanine dyes into biodegradable polymer NPs bearing covalently attached PEG shell. Thus, we propose a simple and robust methodology for preparation of NIR fluorescent biodegradable polymer NPs, which could further improve the existing optical imaging for biomedical applications.",,,,,
35014325,Rational Design of Near-Infrared Cyanine-Based Fluorescent Probes for Rapid In Vivo Sensing Cysteine.,"Cysteine (Cys) is well-known to be an important biothiol and related to many diseases. However, the in situ trapping of endogenous Cys is still handicapped by a lack of straightforward methods combined with long-wavelength emission and high-performance response. In this work, we described the rational design strategy of cyanine-based near-infrared (NIR) probes for the rapid detection of mitochondrial Cys in living cells and mice. We focus on how to improve the response rate via regulating the electron density of the recognition units in probes. The obtained three probes all displayed remarkable fluorescence enhancement at 780 nm. From screening the obtained probes, it was found that the probe Cy-S-diOMe with electron-donating recognition unit displayed the fastest response rate, the lowest detection limit, and the highest signal-to-noise ratio. More importantly, Cy-S-diOMe was successfully applied to monitor Cys in tumor-bearing mice (within merely 5 min). This paradigm by modulation of the response rate in the cyanine dyes provides a promising methodology for the design of high-performance cyanine-based NIR probes.",,,"Animals, Biocompatible Materials, Cysteine, Drug Design, Fluorescent Dyes, HeLa Cells, Humans, Infrared Rays, Materials Testing, Mice, Molecular Structure, Neoplasms, Experimental, Particle Size",,
35001784,Iodinated cyanine dye-based nanosystem for synergistic phototherapy and hypoxia-activated bioreductive therapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been applied in cancer treatment by utilizing reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells. However, the effectiveness of PDT is greatly reduced due to local hypoxia. Hypoxic activated chemotherapy combined with PDT is expected to be a novel strategy to enhance anti-cancer therapy. Herein, a novel liposome (LCT) incorporated with photosensitizer (PS) and bioreductive prodrugs was developed for PDT-activated chemotherapy. In the design, CyI, an iodinated cyanine dye, which could simultaneously generate enhanced ROS and heat than other commonly used cyanine dyes, was loaded into the lipid bilayer; while tirapazamine (TPZ), a hypoxia-activated prodrug was encapsulated in the hydrophilic nucleus. Upon appropriate near-infrared (NIR) irradiation, CyI could simultaneously produce ROS and heat for synergistic PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT), as well as provide fluorescence signals for precise real-time imaging. Meanwhile, the continuous consumption of oxygen would result in a hypoxia microenvironment, further activating TPZ free radicals for chemotherapy, which could induce DNA double-strand breakage and chromosome aberration. Moreover, the prepared LCT could stimulate acute immune response through PDT activation, leading to synergistic PDT/PTT/chemo/immunotherapy to kill cancer cells and reduce tumor metastasis. Both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results demonstrated improved anticancer efficacy of LCT compared with traditional PDT or chemotherapy. It is expected that these iodinated cyanine dyes-based liposomes will provide a powerful and versatile theranostic strategy for tumor target phototherapy and PDT-induced chemotherapy.",,,"Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Cell Survival, Chemistry, Pharmaceutical, Chromosome Aberrations, DNA Damage, Drug Carriers, Drug Liberation, Hypoxia, Liposomes, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Nanoparticle Drug Delivery System, Particle Size, Photosensitizing Agents, Phototherapy, Reactive Oxygen Species, Surface Properties, Tirapazamine, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",,

37621644,Copper-Catalyzed Covalent Dimerization of Near-Infrared Fluorescent Cyanine Dyes: Synergistic Enhancement of Photoacoustic Signals for Molecular Imaging of Tumors.,"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging relies on the absorption of light by chromophores to generate acoustic waves used to delineate tissue structures and physiology. Here, we demonstrate that Cu(II) efficiently catalyzes the dimerization of diverse near-infrared (NIR) cyanine molecules, including a peptide conjugate. NMR spectroscopy revealed a C-C covalent bond along the heptamethine chains, creating stable molecules under conditions such as a wide range of solvents and pH mediums. Dimerization achieved >90% fluorescence quenching, enhanced photostability, and increased PA signals by a factor of about 4 at equimolar concentrations compared to the monomers. <i>In vivo</i> study with a mouse cancer model revealed that dimerization enhanced tumor retention and PA signal, allowing cancer detection at doses where the monomers are less effective. While the dye dimers highlighted peritumoral blood vessels, the PA signal for dimeric tumor-targeting dye-peptide conjugate, LS301, was diffuse throughout the entire tumor mass. A combination of the ease of synthesis, diversity of molecules that are amenable to Cu(II)-catalyzed dimerization, and the high acoustic wave amplification by these stable dimeric small molecules ushers a new strategy to develop clinically translatable PA molecular amplifiers for the emerging field of molecular photoacoustic imaging.",,,,,
34962787,Understanding Self-Assembled Pseudoisocyanine Dye Aggregates in DNA Nanostructures and Their Exciton Relay Transfer Capabilities.,"Progress has been made using B-form DNA duplex strands to template chromophores in ordered molecular aggregates known as J-aggregates. These aggregates can exhibit strong electronic coupling, extended coherent lifetimes, and long-range exciton delocalization under appropriate conditions. Certain cyanine dyes such as pseudoisocyanine (PIC) dye have shown a proclivity to form aggregates in specific DNA sequences. In particular, DX-tiles containing nonalternating poly(dA)-poly(dT) dinucleotide tracks (AT-tracks), which template noncovalent PIC dye aggregates, have been demonstrated to exhibit interesting emergent photonic properties. These DNA-based aggregates are referred to as J-bits for their similarity to J-aggregates. Here, we assemble multifluorophore DX-tile scaffolds which template J-bits into both contiguous and noncontiguous linear arrays. Our goal is to understand the relay capability of noncontiguous J-bit arrays and probe the effects that orientation and position have on the energy transfer between them. We find that linearly contiguous J-bits can relay excitons from an initial AlexaFluor 405 donor to a terminal AlexaFluor 647 acceptor across a distance of up to 16.3 nm. We observed a maximum increase in energy transfer of 41% in the shortest scaffold and an 11% increase in energy transfer across the maximum distance. However, in nonlinear arrays, exciton transfer is not detectable, even when off-axis J-bit-to-J-bit transfer distances were <2 nm. These results, in conjunction with the previous work on PIC-DNA systems, suggest that PIC-DNA-based systems may currently be limited to simple 1-D designs, which prevent isolating J-bits for enhanced energy-transfer characteristics until further understanding and improvements to the system can be made.",,,"Coloring Agents, DNA, Nanostructures, Quinolines",,
34929626,Meso-aryl-substituted thiacarbocyanine dyes as spectral-fluorescent probes for DNA.,"The noncovalent interaction of meso-aryl-substituted thiacarbocyanine dyes I and II with dsDNA and ssDNA in aqueous solutions has been studied by spectral-fluorescent methods. Complexation with DNA is accompanied by both aggregation of the dyes and the formation of monomeric strongly fluorescent complexes. Experiments on molecular docking of dyes I and II with dsDNA confirm the previous assumption about the possibility of the formation of complexes of different types: intercalation between base pairs and in the grooves of the double helix of the biopolymer. The possibility of intercalation of the dyes in the complex is confirmed by experiments on thermal dissociation of dsDNA in the presence of dyes I and II, as well as experiments on the interaction of the dyes with ssDNA. An increase in the melting temperatures T<sub>m</sub> of dsDNA is obtained in the presence of I and II, similar to that observed for the classical intercalator ethidium bromide. The limits of detection and quantification of DNA, which are important for the use of the dyes as probes for DNA, have been determined. The primary photochemical processes of the dyes in complexes with ssDNA were studied by flash photolysis technique. Complexation with ssDNA hinders photoisomerization and creates favorable conditions for the dye triplet state formation. The decay kinetics of the triplet state of the dyes were monoexponential. The rate constant of quenching of the triplet state by air oxygen was estimated for dye I complexed with ssDNA and was found to be less than the diffusion-controlled limit. This is probably a consequence of the shielding effect of the complex on the triplet quenching process.",,,"DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Intercalating Agents, Molecular Docking Simulation, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

34817985,A Peierls Transition in Long Polymethine Molecular Wires: Evolution of Molecular Geometry and Single-Molecule Conductance.,"Molecules capable of mediating charge transport over several nanometers with minimal decay in conductance have fundamental and technological implications. Polymethine cyanine dyes are fascinating molecular wires because up to a critical length, they have no bond-length alternation (BLA) and their electronic structure resembles a one-dimensional free-electron gas. Beyond this threshold, they undergo a symmetry-breaking Peierls transition, which increases the HOMO-LUMO gap. We have investigated cationic cyanines with central polymethine chains of 5-13 carbon atoms (<b>Cy3</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b>-Cy11</b><sup><b>+</b></sup>). The absorption spectra and crystal structures show that symmetry breaking is sensitive to the polarity of the medium and the size of the counterion. X-ray crystallography reveals that <b>Cy9·PF</b><sub><b>6</b></sub> and <b>Cy11·B(C</b><sub><b>6</b></sub><b>F</b><sub><b>5</b></sub><b>)</b><sub><b>4</b></sub> are Peierls distorted, with high BLA at one end of the π-system, away from the partially delocalized positive charge.

At higher bias (0.9 V), the conductance of the shorter chains, <b>Cy3</b><sup><b>+</b></sup><b>-Cy7</b><sup><b>+</b></sup>, increases with length (negative attenuation factor, β = -1.6 nm<sup>-1</sup>), but the conductance still drops in <b>Cy9</b><sup><b>+</b></sup> and <b>Cy11</b><sup><b>+</b></sup> with the small polarizing PF<sub>6</sub><sup>-</sup> counteranion.",,,,,
34783144,A NIR Emitting Cyanine with Large Stokes' Shift for Mitochondria and Identification of their Membrane Potential Disruption.,"An NIR emitting (λ<sub>em</sub> ≈730 nm) cyanine probe ExCy was synthesized in good yields by extending the π-conjugation length (i. e., with furan moiety) to the donor-accepter system. ExCy exhibited a large Stokes' shift (Δλ≈100 nm) due to strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), and high fluorescence quantum yield (Φ<sub>fl</sub> ≈0.47 in DCM). Due to its low fluorescence in an aqueous environment (Φ<sub>fl</sub> ≈0.007 in H<sub>2</sub> O), the probe exhibited the potential of achieving a large fluorescence turn-on upon entering a hydrophobic cellular environment. Fluorescence confocal microscopy studies revealed that ExCy was readily excitable with a far-red laser line (i. e., 640 nm) while the corresponding emission was collected in the NIR region. ExCy exhibited excellent selectivity towards live cell mitochondria according to the co-localization studies. The probe also exhibited high photostability, long-term imaging ability and wash-free staining ability, when being applied to live cells. Our studies indicated that the mitochondrial localization of ExCy was dependent on the membrane potential of the mitochondria. ExCy was successfully utilized as a mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction indicator to visually identify cells with mitochondrial dysfunction via fluorescence confocal microscopy.

34747598,Linear and Nonlinear Optical Processes Controlling S<sub>2</sub> and S<sub>1</sub> Dual Fluorescence in Cyanine Dyes.,"We report on the changes in the dual fluorescence of two cyanine dyes IR144 and IR140 as a function of viscosity and probe their internal conversion dynamics from S<sub>2</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> via their dependence on a femtosecond laser pulse chirp. Steady-state and time-resolved measurements performed in methanol, ethanol, propanol, ethylene glycol, and glycerol solutions are presented. Quantum calculations reveal the presence of three excited states responsible for the experimental observations. Above the first excited state, we find an excited state, which we designate as S<sub>1</sub>', that relaxes to the S<sub>1</sub> minimum, and we find that the S<sub>2</sub> state has two stable configurations. Chirp-dependence measurements, aided by numerical simulations, reveal how internal conversion from S<sub>2</sub> to S<sub>1</sub> depends on solvent viscosity and pulse duration. By combining solvent viscosity, transform-limited pulses, and chirped pulses, we obtain an overall change in the S<sub>2</sub>/S<sub>1</sub> population ratio of a factor of 86 and 55 for IR144 and IR140, respectively. The increase in the S<sub>2</sub>/S<sub>1</sub> ratio is explained by a two-photon transition to a higher excited state. The ability to maximize the population of higher excited states by delaying or bypassing nonradiative relaxation may lead to the increased efficiency of photochemical processes.",,,,,
34723039,Crystal Structures and Optical Properties of Cyanine Dyes Depending on Various Counter Anions.,"In this study, cyanine cations with various counter anions were prepared as examples of ionic materials constructed using charged π-conjugated systems. A series of ion pairs was obtained by anion exchange reactions using iodide salts of carbocyanine dyes. The optical properties were measured by UV/vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy; measurements performed in CHCl<sub>3</sub> (less-polar solvent) were altered by the influence of the counter anions. The packing structures of nine crystals were determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis. Moreover, the locations of the anions relative to the cations were stabilized by hydrogen bonding and categorized into two types. In addition, delocalization of the negative charge of the anions on cyanine cations was explained by density functional theory calculations. Furthermore, it was concluded that the stack formation of cyanine cations depends on the size and structure of the anions.",,,,,
34706127,DNA Aptamer-Cyanine Complexes as Generic Colorimetric Small-Molecule Sensors.,"Aptamers are promising biorecognition elements for sensors. However, aptamer-based assays often lack the requisite levels of sensitivity and/or selectivity because they typically employ structure-switching aptamers with attenuated affinity and/or utilize reporters that require aptamer labeling or which are susceptible to false positives. Dye-displacement assays offer a label-free, sensitive means for overcoming these issues, wherein target binding liberates a dye that is complexed with the aptamer, producing an optical readout. However, broad utilization of these assays has been limited. Here, we demonstrate a rational approach to develop colorimetric cyanine dye-displacement assays that can be broadly applied to DNA aptamers regardless of their structure, sequence, affinity, or the physicochemical properties of their targets. Our approach should accelerate the development of mix-and-measure assays that could be applied for diverse analytical applications.",,,,,
34689764,Unsymmetrical cyanine dye via in vivo hitchhiking endogenous albumin affords high-performance NIR-II/photoacoustic imaging and photothermal therapy.,"Herein, an unprecedented synergistic strategy for the development of high-performance NIR-II fluorophore is proposed and validated. Based on an unsymmetrical cyanine dye design strategy, the NIR-II emissive dye NIC was successfully developed by replacing only one of the indoline donors of symmetrical cyanine dye ICG with a fully conjugated benz[c,d]indole donor. This minor structural change maximally maintains the high extinction coefficient advantage of cyanine dyes. NIC-ER with endogenous albumin-hitchhiking capability was constructed to further enhance its in vivo fluorescence brightness. In the presence of HSA (Human serum albumin), NIC-ER spontaneously resides in the albumin pocket, and a brilliant ~89-fold increase in fluorescence was observed. Due to its high molar absorptivity and moderate quantum yield, NIC-ER in HSA exhibits bright NIR-II emission with high photostability and significant Stokes shift (>110 nm). Moreover, NIC-ER was successfully employed for tumor-targeted NIR-II/PA imaging and efficient photothermal tumor elimination. Overall, our strategy may open up a new avenue for designing and constructing high-performance NIR-II fluorophores.",,,"Albumins, Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Coloring Agents, Mice, Mice, Nude, Neoplasms, Experimental, Photoacoustic Techniques, Photothermal Therapy, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,

In this study, four novel pentamethine indolizine cyanine dyes were synthesized with <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethylaniline-based substituents on the indolizine periphery at varied substitution sites. The dyes are studied via computational chemistry and optical spectroscopy both in solution and when encapsulated. Dramatic spectral shifts in the absorption and emission spectrum wavelengths with added donor groups are observed.

34641533,Photodynamic Therapy with Tumor Cell Discrimination through RNA-Targeting Ability of Photosensitizer.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents an effective treatment to cure cancer. The targeting ability of the photosensitizer is of utmost importance. Photosensitizers that discriminate cancer cells can avoid the killing of normal cells and improve PDT efficacy. However, the design and synthesis of photosensitizers conjugated with a recognition unit of cancer cell markers is complex and may not effectively target cancer. Considering that the total RNA content in cancer cells is commonly higher than in normal cells, this study has developed the photosensitizer <b>QICY</b> with RNA-targeting abilities for the discrimination of cancer cells. <b>QICY</b> was specifically located in cancer cells rather than normal cells due to their stronger electrostatic interactions with RNA, thereby further improving the PDT effects on the cancer cells. After intravenous injection into mice bearing a xenograft tumor, <b>QICY</b> accumulated into the tumor location through the enhanced permeability and retention effect, automatically targeted cancer cells under the control of RNA, and inhibited tumor growth under 630 nm laser irradiation without obvious side effects. This intelligent photosensitizer with RNA-targeting ability not only simplifies the design and synthesis of cancer-cell-targeting photosensitizers but also paves the way for the further development of highly efficient PDTs.",,,"Animals, COS Cells, Cell Line, Tumor, Chlorocebus aethiops, Female, Humans, Injections, Intravenous, Low-Level Light Therapy, MCF-7 Cells, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Molecular Targeted Therapy, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, RNA, Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays, Mice",,
34640007,Aggregate Formation of Boron-Containing Molecules in Thermal Vacuum Deposited Films.,"The spectral properties of new boron-containing dyes were studied. One-component (pure dyes) and composite ""Alq<sub>3</sub>+dye"" thin films were fabricated using the thermal vacuum deposition method. The positions of the transmission spectra maxima in a one-component film are different for different film thicknesses. The best correlation of the maxima positions of the dye transmission spectra in solid and liquid solutions was observed for thicknesses of films close to a few (up to 10) monolayers. On the other hand, the absorption spectra maxima positions of one-component dye films (upper 10 nm) and composite films with high concentration, did not match the corresponding positions of absorption spectra maxima recorded in solutions. Comparison of the absorption spectra in one-component dye films and in solutions indicates the presence of both monomers and their aggregates in one-component films (contrary to solutions where such processes of aggregation do not take place, even at very high concentrations). Simultaneously with aggregation manifestation in the absorption spectra, the intensity of fluorescence of one-component dye films dramatically decreases. A quantum chemical simulation of the possible relative arrangement of two dye molecules indicates that the most possible of the simplest types of aggregates are physical dimers. Films of practical importance (due to efficient energy transfer from host to guest molecules when all singlet excitons are captured) possess a high quantum yield of fluorescence when reaching an impurity concentration of a few percent (aggregation does not take place yet).",,,,,
34606673,Targetable Conformationally Restricted Cyanines Enable Photon-Count-Limited Applications*.,"Cyanine dyes are exceptionally useful probes for a range of fluorescence-based applications, but their photon output can be limited by trans-to-cis photoisomerization. We recently demonstrated that appending a ring system to the pentamethine cyanine ring system improves the quantum yield and extends the fluorescence lifetime. Here, we report an optimized synthesis of persulfonated variants that enable efficient labeling of nucleic acids and proteins. We demonstrate that a bifunctional sulfonated tertiary amide significantly improves the optical properties of the resulting bioconjugates. These new conformationally restricted cyanines are compared to the parent cyanine derivatives in a range of contexts. These include their use in the plasmonic hotspot of a DNA-nanoantenna, in single-molecule Förster-resonance energy transfer (FRET) applications, far-red fluorescence-lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). These efforts define contexts in which eliminating cyanine isomerization provides meaningful benefits to imaging performance.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Molecular Conformation, Photons",,
34592003,Counterion Pairing Effects on a Flavylium Heptamethine Dye.,"Polymethine fluorophores have facilitated the advance of biological and material sciences, due to their advantageous photophysical properties. However, the need to maintain a monomeric state can severely limit the utility and processability of dyes. High concentrations of fluorophore can lead to aggregation and negate the beneficial photophysical properties of monomers. Another concern is ""crossing the cyanine limit"" in which delocalization within the polymethine scaffold is broken, producing the presence of an asymmetric state diminishing its photophysical behavior. Herein, we attempt to overcome these limitations by exploring anion exchange on a cationic flavylium heptamethine scaffold. By increasing the size and hydrophobicity of the anion, we can effectively tune the degree of ion pairing within the polymethine dye. Interestingly, we found that the effect of ion pairing on photophysical properties was subtle for the flavylium heptamethine scaffold in comparison to the more commonly used indolenine cyanine dye. Utilizing larger weakly coordinating anions enabled solubility of the flavylium heptamethine fluorophore in nonpolar solvents, which could otherwise not be achieved. Even with more subtle effects than classic cyanine dyes, anion exchange on flavylium polymethine dyes holds potential for further manipulation of the properties of these low energy dyes.",,,"Anions, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Solubility, Solvents",,

On the contrary, nanoscale metal-organic particles are considered to be a promising platform because of their biocompatibility and efficient metabolism. Herein, HA@Cy-Cu NPs are prepared using the coordination-driven assembly of cyanine dyes with Cu<sup>2+</sup> ions. HA@Cy-Cu NPs demonstrate excellent synergistic PTT/CDT, a high photothermal conversion efficiency (43%), and enhanced photostability. Moreover, Cu<sup>2+</sup> in the NPs can be reduced to Cu<sup>+</sup> by glutathione (GSH) and can transform H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> to •OH, which down-regulates intracellular GSH levels and up-regulates significant oxidative damage. Therefore, promising in vivo tumor ablation is observed at a low dose of HA@Cy-Cu, suggesting that the combination of PTT/CDT greatly improved the antitumor performance.

The novel compounds showed strong, micromolar and submicromolar affinities to all examined DNA ds-polynucleotides and poly rA-poly rU. The compounds studied showed selectivity towards GC-DNA base pairs over AT-DNA, which included both binding affinity and a strong fluorescence response. CD titrations showed aggregation along the polynucleotide with well-defined supramolecular chirality. The single dipyridinium-bridged dimer showed intercalation at low dye-DNA/RNA ratios.

These agents are devoid of appreciable cytotoxic or cytostatic effects, and medicinal chemistry efforts to modify them into anticancer agents are rare. A drug repurposing campaign initiated in our laboratory with the primary focus of discovering brain cancer drugs resulted in drug-dye conjugate 1, a combination of the cytoprotective agent troxipide and heptamethine cyanine dye MHI 148. The drug-dye conjugate 1 was evaluated in three different patient-derived adult glioblastoma cell lines, commercially available U87 glioblastoma, and one paediatric glioblastoma cell line. In all cases, the conjugate 1 showed potent cytotoxic activity with nanomolar potency (EC<sub>50</sub>: 267 nM). Interestingly, troxipide alone does not show any cytotoxic and cytostatic activity in the above cell lines. We also observe a synergistic effect of 1 with temozolomide (TMZ), the standard drug used for glioblastoma treatment, even though the cell lines we used in this study were resistant to TMZ treatment.

34432445,Mechanism of Cyanine5 to Cyanine3 Photoconversion and Its Application for High-Density Single-Particle Tracking in a Living Cell.,"Cyanine (Cy) dyes are among the most useful organic fluorophores that have found a wide range of applications in single-molecule and super-resolution imaging as well as in other biophysical studies. However, recent observations that blueshifted derivatives of Cy dyes are formed via photoconversion have raised concerns as to the potential artifacts in multicolor imaging. Here, we report the mechanism for the photoconversion of Cy5 to Cy3 that occurs upon photoexcitation during fluorescent imaging. Our studies show that the formal C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub> excision from Cy5 occurs mainly through an intermolecular pathway involving a combination of bond cleavage and reconstitution while unambiguously confirming the identity of the fluorescent photoproduct of Cy5 to be Cy3 using various spectroscopic tools. The carbonyl products generated from singlet oxygen-mediated photooxidation of Cy5 undergo a sequence of carbon-carbon bond-breaking and -forming events to bring about the novel dye-to-dye transformation. We also show that the deletion of a two-methine unit from the polymethine chain, which results in the formation of blueshifted products, commonly occurs in other cyanine dyes, such as Alexa Fluor 647 (AF647) and Cyanine5.5. The formation of a blueshifted congener dye can obscure the multicolor fluorescence imaging, leading to misinterpretation of the data. We demonstrate that the potentially deleterious photoconversion, however, can be exploited to develop a new photoactivation method for high-density single-particle tracking in a living cell without using UV illumination and cell-toxic additives.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, HeLa Cells, Humans, Light, Models, Chemical, Oxidation-Reduction, Photochemical Processes, Single Molecule Imaging",,

NIR-II fluorescence imaging provides better imaging contrast and penetration depth, benefiting from the reducing photon scattering, light absorption and autofluorescence. The majority of current NIR-II fluorophores suffer from uncontrollable emission wavelength and low quantum yields issues, impeding the clinical translation of NIR-II bioimaging. By lengthening the polymethine chain, tailoring heterocyclic modification and conjugating electron-donating groups, cyanine dyes have been proved to be ideal NIR-II fluorophores with both tunable emission and brightness. However, a simpler and faster method for synthesizing NIR-II dyes with longer wavelengths and better stability still needs to be explored. This minireview will outline the recent progress of cyanine dyes with NIR-II emission, particularly emphasizing their pharmacokinetic enhancement and potential clinical translation.",,,,,
34345667,Defining the Basis of Cyanine Phototruncation Enables a New Approach to Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy.,"The light-promoted conversion of extensively used cyanine dyes to blue-shifted emissive products has been observed in various contexts. However, both the underlying mechanism and the species involved in this photoconversion reaction have remained elusive. Here we report that irradiation of heptamethine cyanines provides pentamethine cyanines, which, in turn, are photoconverted to trimethine cyanines. We detail an examination of the mechanism and substrate scope of this remarkable two-carbon phototruncation reaction. Supported by computational analysis, we propose that this reaction involves a singlet oxygen-initiated multistep sequence involving a key hydroperoxycyclobutanol intermediate. Building on this mechanistic framework, we identify conditions to improve the yield of photoconversion by over an order of magnitude. We then demonstrate that cyanine phototruncation can be applied to super-resolution single-molecule localization microscopy, leading to improved spatial resolution with shorter imaging times. We anticipate these insights will help transform a common, but previously mechanistically ill-defined, chemical transformation into a valuable optical tool.",,,,,
34310127,Shining Light on Cyclopentadienone-Norbornadiene Diels-Alder Adducts to Enable Photoinduced Click Chemistry with Cyclopentadiene.,"A new Diels-Alder (DA)-based photopatterning platform is presented, which exploits the irreversible, light-induced decarbonylation and subsequent cleavage of cyclopentadienone-norbornadiene (CPD-NBD) adducts. A series of CPD-NBD adducts have been prepared and systematically studied toward the use in a polymeric material photopatterning platform. By incorporating an optimized CPD-NBD adduct into polymer networks, it is demonstrated that cyclopentadiene may be unveiled upon 365 nm irradiation and subsequently clicked to a variety of maleimides with spatial control under mild reaction conditions and with fast kinetics. Unlike currently available photoinduced Diels-Alder reactions that rely on trapping transient, photocaged dienes, this platform introduces a persistent, yet highly reactive diene after irradiation, enabling the use of photosensitive species such as cyanine dyes to be patterned. To highlight the potential use of this platform in a variety of material applications, we demonstrate two proof-of-concepts: patterned conjugation of multiple dyes into a polyacrylate network and preprogrammed ligation of streptavidin into poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels.",,,,,

34280796,Photonics of meso-substituted carbocyanine dyes in solutions and in complexes with DNA.,"Spectral-fluorescent and photochemical properties (photoisomerization and generation of the triplet state) of meso-substituted cationic carbocyanine dyes, 3,3'-di-(β-hydroxyethyl)-5,5'-dimethoxy-9-ethylthiacarbocyanine iodide (K1) and 3,3'-di-(β-hydroxyethyl)-9-methylthiacarbocyanine iodide (K2), have been studied in solutions and in the presence of DNA. In solutions, on passing from acetonitrile to dioxane, a growth of fluorescence of the dyes is observed due to a shift of the equilibrium of cis/trans isomers toward the fluorescent trans-isomer. Upon flash photolysis of dye solutions in dioxane, the formation and subsequent decay of the cis-photoisomers of the dyes are observed. In aqueous solutions, the interaction with DNA leads to the formation of noncovalent complexes of K1 and K2 with DNA, which is accompanied by a significant increase in the fluorescence intensity. The results of the molecular docking experiments showed the possibility of several types of binding, which was confirmed by the data obtained from other experiments. The effects of temperature and additions of NaCl on the stability of the dye-DNA complexes were studied. The spectral-fluorescent data were used to estimate the binding constants of the dyes with DNA and other characteristics of the dyes that are important for their use as probes. Upon flash photolysis of the dyes in complexes with DNA, photoisomerization is not observed, but the quantum yield of intersystem crossing to the triplet state increases. The decay of the triplet states occurs by a two-exponential law. The rate constants for quenching of the triplet states of the dyes complexed with DNA by oxygen were found to be lower than the expected values for diffusion-controlled quenching (taking into account the spin statistical factor 1/9), which is explained by the steric factor of complexation.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Docking Simulation, Optics and Photonics, Solutions",,
34264465,Quantifying Staphylococcus aureus Membrane Potential Using Flow Cytometry.,"Quantifying fluorescent markers in cell populations using flow cytometry has been a powerful technological advance. Fluorescent properties of cyanine dyes coupled with flow cytometry allow investigators to monitor the membrane potential (MP), an important component of the proton motive force (PMF). MP (or ΔΨ) is the electrical potential across the cell membrane. The other component of the PMF is ΔpH, or the difference in interior and exterior proton concentrations. MP plays a critical role in bacterial physiology. In Staphylococcus aureus, MP is required for generation of ATP, regulating autolytic activity, maintaining ion homeostasis, and resistance to some classes of antibiotics. This protocol exploits unique spectral and physical properties of the cyanine-based molecule diethyloxacarbocyanine iodide, or DiOC, and flow cytometry technology to quantify MP in S. aureus.

34249874,Recent Advances in Cyanine-Based Phototherapy Agents.,"Phototherapies, in the form of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), are very promising treatment modalities for cancer since they provide locality and turn-on mechanism for toxicity, both of which are critical in reducing off-site toxicity. Irradiation of photosensitive agents demonstrated successful therapeutic outcomes; however, each approach has its limitations and needs to be improved for clinical success. The combination of PTT and PDT may work in a synergistic way to overcome the limitations of each method and indeed improve the treatment efficacy. The development of single photosensitive agents capable of inducing both PDT and PTT is, therefore, extremely advantageous and highly desired. Cyanine dyes are shown to have such potential, hence have been very popular in the recent years. Luminescence of cyanine dyes renders them as phototheranostic molecules, reporting the localization of the photosensitive agent prior to irradiation to induce phototoxicity, hence allowing image-guided phototherapy.

34199144,Cyanine Dyes for Photo-Thermal Therapy: A Comparison of Synthetic Liposomes and Natural Erythrocyte-Based Carriers.,"Cyanine fluorescent dyes are attractive diagnostic or therapeutic agents due to their excellent optical properties. However, in free form, their use in biological applications is limited due to the short circulation time, instability, and toxicity. Therefore, their encapsulation into nano-carriers might help overcome the above-mentioned issues. In addition to indocyanine green (ICG), which is clinically approved and therefore the most widely used fluorescent dye, we tested the structurally similar and cheaper alternative called IR-820. Both dyes were encapsulated into liposomes. However, due to the synthetic origin of liposomes, they can induce an immunogenic response. To address this challenge, we proposed to use erythrocyte membrane vesicles (EMVs) as ""new era"" nano-carriers for cyanine dyes. The optical properties of both dyes were investigated in different biological relevant media. Then, the temperature stability and photo-stability of dyes in free form and encapsulated into liposomes and EMVs were evaluated. Nano-carriers efficiently protected dyes from thermal degradation, as well as from photo-induced degradation. Finally, a hemotoxicity study revealed that EMVs seem less hemotoxic dye carriers than clinically approved liposomes.

The dyes possess low fluorescence intensity in an unbound state, which is increased up to 479 times in the presence of the nucleic acids. In the presence of RNAs, the fluorescence intensity increase was stronger than that observed in the presence of dsDNA. Next, we have performed staining of live and fixed cells by all prepared dyes. The dyes proved to be cell and nuclear membrane permeant. They are photostable and brightly stain RNA-containing organelles in both live and fixed cells. The colocalization confirmed the specific nucleoli staining with anti-Ki-67 antibodies. The RNA digestion experiment has confirmed the selectivity of the dyes toward intracellular RNA.

There is, however, only scant literature information related to one-electron reduced cyanine dyes, especially in an aqueous environment. Here, we examine a small series of cyanine dyes, possessing disparate π-conjugation lengths, under selective reducing or oxidizing conditions. The experiment allows recording of both differential absorption spectra and decay kinetics of the resultant one-electron reduced or oxidized transient species in water. Relative to the ground state, absorption transitions for the various radicals are weak and somewhat broadened but do allow correlation with the π-conjugation length. In all cases, absorption maxima lie to the blue of the main ground-state transition. Under anaerobic conditions, the transient species decay on the microsecond to millisecond time scale, with the mean lifetime depending on molecular structure, radiation dose, and dye concentration. The experimental absorption spectra recorded for the one-electron reduced radicals and the presumed dimer cation radical compare well to spectra obtained from time-dependent density functional theory calculations. The results allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the plausibility of the reduced species being responsible for light-induced blinking in direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy.",,,,,

34142803,DNA Minor Groove-Induced <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> Isomerization of a Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe.,"The discovery of small molecules that exhibit turn-on far-red or near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence upon DNA binding and understanding how they bind DNA are important for imaging and bioanalytical applications. Here we report the DNA-bound structure and the DNA binding mechanism of quinone cyanine dithiazole (QCy-DT), a recently reported AT-specific turn-on NIR fluorescent probe for double-stranded DNA. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-derived structure showed minor groove binding but no specific ligand-DNA interactions, consistent with an endothermic and entropy-driven binding mechanism deduced from isothermal titration calorimetry. Minor groove binding is typically fast because it minimally perturbs the DNA structure. However, QCy-DT exhibited unusually slow DNA binding. The cyanine-based probe is capable of <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> isomerization due to overlapping methine bridges, with 16 possible slowly interconverting <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> isomers. Using NMR, density functional theory, and free energy calculations, we show that the DNA-free and DNA-bound environments of QCy-DT prefer distinctly different isomers, indicating that the origin of the slow kinetics is a <i>cis</i>-<i>trans</i> isomerization and that the minor groove preferentially selects an otherwise unstable <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> isomer of QCy-DT. Flux analysis showed the conformational selection pathway to be the dominating DNA binding mechanism at low DNA concentrations, which switches to the induced fit pathway at high DNA concentrations. This report of <i>cis</i>/<i>trans</i> isomerization of a ligand, upon binding the DNA minor groove, expands the prevailing understanding of unique discriminatory powers of the minor groove and has an important bearing on using polymethine cyanine dyes to probe the kinetics of molecular interactions.",,,"Benzothiazoles, DNA, Density Functional Theory, Fluorescent Dyes, Isomerism, Ligands, Models, Chemical, Molecular Docking Simulation, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Thermodynamics",,
34141613,The Use of Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes as Drug-Conjugate Systems in the Treatment of Primary and Metastatic Brain Tumors.,"Effective cancer therapeutics for brain tumors must be able to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to reach the tumor in adequate quantities and overcome the resistance conferred by the local tumor microenvironment. Clinically approved chemotherapeutic agents have been investigated for brain neoplasms, but despite their effectiveness in peripheral cancers, failed to show therapeutic success in brain tumors. This is largely due to their poor bioavailability and specificity towards brain tumors. A targeted delivery system might improve the efficacy of the candidate compounds by increasing the retention time in the tumor tissue, and minimizing the numerous side effects associated with the non-specific distribution of the chemotherapy agent. Heptamethine cyanine dyes (HMCDs) are a class of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) compounds that have recently emerged as promising agents for drug delivery. Initially explored for their use in imaging and monitoring neoplasms, their tumor-targeting properties have recently been investigated for their use as drug carrier systems. This review will explore the recent developments in the tumour-targeting properties of a specific group of NIRF cyanine dyes and the preclinical evidence for their potential as drug-delivery systems in the treatment of primary and metastatic brain tumors.",,,,,
34106696,Ultrabright Fluorescent Polymeric Nanofibers and Coatings Based on Ionic Dye Insulation with Bulky Counterions.,"Preparation of bright fluorescent materials based on polymers is hampered by a fundamental problem of aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) of encapsulated dyes. Here, ultrabright fluorescent polymeric nanofibers and coatings are prepared based on a concept of ionic dye insulation with bulky hydrophobic counterions that overcomes the ACQ problem. It is found that bulky hydrophobic counterion perfluorinated tetraphenylborate can boost >100-fold the fluorescence quantum yields of cationic dye octadecyl rhodamine B at high loading (30 wt %) in biocompatible poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). The concept is applicable to both rhodamine and cyanine dyes, which results in bright fluorescent polymeric materials of four different colors spanning from blue to near-infrared. It allows for preparation of electrospun polymeric nanofibers with >50-fold higher dye loading by mass (30 wt %, >20-fold higher molarity for rhodamine dyes) while preserving good fluorescence quantum yields (31%), which implies drastic improvement in their fluorescence brightness. The counterion-based polymeric materials are also validated as coatings of model medical devices, such as stainless steel fiducials and 3D-printed stents of complex geometry. Spin-coated fluorescent polymeric films loaded with a dye paired with bulky counterions exhibit excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity. Moreover, counterion-modified materials show much better stability against dye leakage in the presence of living cells and a serum-containing medium, compared to materials based on the dye with a small inorganic anion. Overall, by pushing the barriers of ACQ, our counterion approach emerges as a powerful tool to develop ultrabright fluorescent polymeric materials ranging from nano- and macroscale.",,,,,
34094186,Cyclooctatetraene-conjugated cyanine mitochondrial probes minimize phototoxicity in fluorescence and nanoscopic imaging.,"Modern fluorescence-imaging methods promise to unveil organelle dynamics in live cells. Phototoxicity, however, has become a prevailing issue when boosted illumination applies. Mitochondria are representative organelles whose research heavily relies on optical imaging, yet these membranous hubs of bioenergy are exceptionally vulnerable to photodamage. We report that cyclooctatetraene-conjugated cyanine dyes (PK Mito dyes), are ideal mitochondrial probes with remarkably low photodynamic damage for general use in fluorescence cytometry. In contrast, the nitrobenzene conjugate of Cy3 exhibits enhanced photostability but unaffected phototoxicity compared to parental Cy3. PK Mito Red, in conjunction with Hessian-structural illumination microscopy, enables 2000-frame time-lapse imaging with clearly resolvable crista structures, revealing rich mitochondrial dynamics. In a rigorous stem cell sorting and transplantation assay, PK Mito Red maximally retains the stemness of planarian neoblasts, exhibiting excellent multifaceted biocompatibility. Resonating with the ongoing theme of reducing photodamage using optical approaches, this work advocates the evaluation and minimization of phototoxicity when developing imaging probes.",,,,,
34091025,Evaluation of changes in Caenorhabditis elegans immune response during bacterial infection: a single nematode approach.,"Routinely, studies were performed using age-synchronized group of Caenorhabditis elegans as host which suggested a collective response by the host system. Here, we report the modulation of immune response in a single nematode against Staphylococcus aureus and Proteus mirabilis. Initially, the survival of wild-type N2 was tested and was found that S. aureus killed single nematode at 42 h while P. mirabilis failed to provoke infection but colonized the nematode's intestine. With this milieu, the pathogenicity of the bacteria was assessed by Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy and Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and was found that S. aureus in the presence of host elicited its virulence while P. mirabilis and Escherichia coli OP50 did not show any alteration. Vertical transmission of infection was also deduced by colony forming unit assay using Cyanine dyes. The MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis was also performed to identify the proteome changes in the single nematode that showcased different proteins related to various immune pathways. This study suggested the importance of understanding the infection pathology and traits of individual nematode which could help our understanding on otherwise the disordered processes during host and microbe interactions.",,,"Animals, Caenorhabditis elegans, Escherichia coli, Immunity, Staphylococcal Infections, Staphylococcus aureus, Virulence",,
34081463,Near-Infrared Heptamethine Cyanine Dyes for Nanoparticle-Based Photoacoustic Imaging and Photothermal Therapy.,"We have synthesized and characterized a library of near-infrared (NIR) heptamethine cyanine dyes for biomedical application as photoacoustic imaging and photothermal agents. These hydrophobic dyes were incorporated into a polymer-based nanoparticle system to provide aqueous solubility and protection of the photophysical properties of each dye scaffold. Among those heptamethine cyanine dyes analyzed, 13 compounds within the nontoxic polymeric nanoparticles have been selected to exemplify structural relationships in terms of photostability, photoacoustic imaging, and photothermal behavior within the NIR (∼650-850 nm) spectral region. The most contributing structural features observed in our dye design include hydrophobicity, rotatable bonds, heavy atom effects, and stability of the central cyclohexene ring within the dye core. The NIR agents developed within this project serve to elicit a structure-function relationship with emphasis on their photoacoustic and photothermal characteristics aiming at producing customizable NIR photoacoustic and photothermal tools for clinical use.",,,"Cell Line, Tumor, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indoles, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Nanoparticles, Photoacoustic Techniques, Photothermal Therapy",,
34072719,Potential of Cyanine Derived Dyes in Photodynamic Therapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a method of cancer treatment that leads to the disintegration of cancer cells and has developed significantly in recent years. The clinically used photosensitizers are primarily porphyrin, which absorbs light in the red spectrum and their absorbance maxima are relatively short. This review presents group of compounds and their derivatives that are considered to be potential photosensitizers in PDT. Cyanine dyes are compounds that typically absorb light in the visible to near-infrared-I (NIR-I) spectrum range (750-900 nm). This meta-analysis comprises the current studies on cyanine dye derivatives, such as indocyanine green (so far used solely as a diagnostic agent), heptamethine and pentamethine dyes, squaraine dyes, merocyanines and phthalocyanines. The wide array of the cyanine derivatives arises from their structural modifications (e.g., halogenation, incorporation of metal atoms or organic structures, or synthesis of lactosomes, emulsions or conjugation). All the following modifications aim to increase solubility in aqueous media, enhance phototoxicity, and decrease photobleaching. In addition, the changes introduce new features like pH-sensitivity. The cyanine dyes involved in photodynamic reactions could be incorporated into sets of PDT agents.",,,,,
34067065,In Vitro and In Vivo Cell Uptake of a Cell-Penetrating Peptide Conjugated with Fluorescent Dyes Having Different Chemical Properties.,"In molecular imaging, a targeting strategy with ligands is widely used because specificity can be significantly improved. In fluorescence imaging based on a targeting strategy, the fluorescent dyes conjugated with ligands may affect the targeting efficiency depending on the chemical properties. Herein, we used a cell-penetrating peptide (CPP) as a ligand with a variety of fluorescent cyanine dye. We investigated in vitro and in vivo cell uptake of the dye-CPP conjugates when cyanine dyes with differing charge and hydrophilicity/lipophilicity were used. The results showed that the conjugates with positively charged and lipophilic cyanine dyes accumulated in cancer cells in vitro, but there was almost no accumulation in tumors in vivo. On the other hand, the conjugates with negatively charged and hydrophilic cyanine dyes did not accumulate in cancer cells in vitro, but fluorescence was observed in tumors in vivo. These results show that there are some cases in which the cell uptake of the dye-peptide conjugates may differ significantly between in vitro and in vivo experiments due to the chemical properties of the fluorescent dyes. This suggests that attention should be paid to the chemical properties of fluorescent dyes in fluorescence imaging based on a targeting strategy.",,,,,
34059711,Fluorescent base analogues in gapmers enable stealth labeling of antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics.,"To expand the antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) fluorescence labeling toolbox beyond covalent conjugation of external dyes (e.g. ATTO-, Alexa Fluor-, or cyanine dyes), we herein explore fluorescent base analogues (FBAs) as a novel approach to endow fluorescent properties to ASOs. Both cytosine and adenine analogues (tC, tC<sup>O</sup>, 2CNqA, and pA) were incorporated into a 16mer ASO sequence with a 3-10-3 cEt-DNA-cEt (cEt = constrained ethyl) gapmer design. In addition to a comprehensive photophysical characterization, we assess the label-induced effects on the gapmers' RNA affinities, RNA-hybridized secondary structures, and knockdown efficiencies. Importantly, we find practically no perturbing effects for gapmers with single FBA incorporations in the biologically critical gap region and, except for pA, the FBAs do not affect the knockdown efficiencies. Incorporating two cytosine FBAs in the gap is equally well tolerated, while two adenine analogues give rise to slightly reduced knockdown efficiencies and what could be perturbed secondary structures. We furthermore show that the FBAs can be used to visualize gapmers inside live cells using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry, enabling comparative assessment of their uptake. This altogether shows that FBAs are functional ASO probes that provide a minimally perturbing in-sequence labeling option for this highly relevant drug modality.",,,"Cell Survival, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescent Dyes, HEK293 Cells, Humans, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Oligonucleotides, Antisense, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcription, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",,

Probes that happen to be based on cyanine dyes exhibit strong NIR-absorbing and efficient photothermal conversion, representing a new class of photothermal agents (PAs) for photothermal therapy (PTT), and taking into account the heat susceptibility of Mitochondria (Mito), we designed and prepared a mitochondria-targeted organic small molecule (Mito-BWQ) based on thiazole orange maternal unit that can effectively kill tumor cells through the hyperpyrexia generated in the lesions under exogenous laser irradiation. The Confocal laser scanning microscope was employed to determine the preferential targeting of Mito-BWQ to the mitochondria of MCF-7 cells and U87 cells. When subjected to 600 nm laser radiation, Mito-BWQ produced an increase in temperature in test systems and this increase was dependent on both the laser power and probe concentration. In vitro tests, cytotoxicity was observed when cells were incubated with Mito-BWQ and exposed to laser irradiation. The PTT in vivo also showed that Mito-BWQ performed remarkably in tumor inhibition. This study thus provides a vital starting point for the creation of thiazole orange-based PTT formulations and promotes further advances in the field of PAs-based anticancer research and therapy.",,,"Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Benzothiazoles, Cell Proliferation, Cell Survival, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor, Female, Humans, Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Mitochondria, Molecular Structure, Photothermal Therapy, Quinolines, Structure-Activity Relationship, Tumor Cells, Cultured",,

Heptamethine cyanine dyes (Cy7) have suitable fluorescence properties but it is challenging to create activatable probes because Cy7 dyes have a propensity for self-aggregation and fluorescence quenching. A new synthetic strategy is employed to create a generalizable class of hydrophilic bioresponsive near-infrared fluorescent probes with appended sulfonates that provide excellent physiochemical properties. A prototype version is triggered by nitroreductase enzyme to undergo self-immolative cleavage with a large enhancement in fluorescence signal at 780 nm and the probe enables microscopic imaging of cell hypoxia with ""turn on"" fluorescence. Near-infrared fluorescence imaging of hypoxia is potentially useful in many different areas of biomedical research and clinical treatment.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Carbocyanines, Humans, Cell Hypoxia, Optical Imaging, Infrared Rays, Molecular Structure, Sulfonic Acids",,
33975703,A hybrid aggregate FRET probe from the mixed assembly of cyanine dyes for highly specific monitoring of mitochondria autophagy.,"Mitochondria autophagy, also known as mitophagy, is a process in which mitochondria are wrapped by autophagosomes and fused with lysosomes for degradation. This process is essential for mitochondrial quality control. Here, we developed a hybrid aggregate FRET probe through mixed assembly of two cyanine dyes FMOTY and AMTC. In live cells, FMOTY and AMTC exist independently in lysosomes and mitochondria and will not produce interfering FRET background signals. The FRET signal is only generated when mitochondria is transported to lysosomes during mitophagy. This allows the hybridized aggregate to be used as a highly specific probe for monitoring mitophagy.",,,"Autophagosomes, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Lysosomes, Mitochondria, Mitophagy",,

The synthesis of polymethines through the reaction of Zincke salts with several amines, followed by a Knoevenagel reaction with malononitrile, was accomplished in moderate to high yields (40-92 %). Meanwhile, the reaction of Zincke salts with secondary amines and the subsequent sequential condensation-cyclization with cyclopentadienide ions, so-called Ziegler-Hafner method, produced the corresponding 1,6'-biazulenes, 1,6';3,6''-terazulenes, and quinqueazulene, respectively. The structural, optical, and electrochemical properties of the azulene-substituted donor-acceptor polymethines, bi-, ter-, and quinqueazulenes were revealed by single-crystal X-ray structure analysis, UV/vis spectroscopy, voltammetry analysis, spectroelectrochemistry, and theoretical calculations. These results suggested that the substituents on the azulene ring and their substitution positions directly affect their reactivities, optical and electrochemical properties.",,,,,
33954311,Exploiting cyanine dye J-aggregates/monomer equilibrium in hydrophobic protein pockets for efficient multi-step phototherapy: an innovative concept for smart nanotheranostics.,"After several decades of development in the field of near-infrared (NIR) dyes for photothermal therapy (PTT), indocyanine green (ICG) still remains the only FDA-approved NIR contrast agent. However, upon NIR light irradiation ICG can react with molecular oxygen to form reactive oxygen species and degrade the ICG core, losing the convenient dye properties. In this work, we introduce a new approach for expanding the application of ICG in nanotheranostics, which relies on the confinement of self-organized J-type aggregates in hydrophobic protein domains acting as monomer depots. Upon the fast photobleaching, while the dye is irradiated, this strategy permits the equilibrium-driven monomer replacement after each irradiation cycle that radically increases the systems' effectivity and applicability. Gadolinium-doped casein micelles were designed to prove this novel concept at the same time as endowing the nanosystems with further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) ability for dual-modal imaging-guided PTT. By teaching a new trick to a very old dog, the clinical prospect of ICG will undoubtedly be boosted laying the foundation for novel therapeutics.

Apart from the huge challenge in pushing absorption profile into NIR-II region, fine-tuning dyes' excited state via rational structure design to meet all three functions, especially oxygen photosensitization, remains the most prominent throttle. Herein, five novel NIR-II dyes (BHs) are productively developed by strategically conjugating dyad innovative xanthonium with sequentially extended polymethine bridges, enabling intense absorption from 890 to 1206 nm, significantly 400 nm longer than conventional cyanine dyes with same polymethines. More importantly, owning to high resonance and favorable excited state energy population induced by greater rigidity via ring-fused amino, BH 1024 exhibits best singlet oxygen generation capability, moderate photothermal heating, and considerable fluorescence under 1064 nm laser irradiation. Furthermore, BH 1024 is encapsulated into folate-functionalized polymer, which demonstrated a synergetic PDT/PTT effect in vitro and in vivo, eventually achieving solid tumors elimination under NIR-II fluorescence guide. As far as it is known, this is the first time small molecular dyes for NIR-II PDT or NIR-II PDT/PTT are explored and designed.",,,"Coloring Agents, Humans, Indoles, Lasers, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy",,

33713894,Development of biotin-tagged near-infrared fluorescence probes for tumor-specific imaging.,"Near-infrared (NIR) probes are applicable for tumor imaging due to deep tissue penetration and low background signal. And cyanine dyes with long emission wavelength are excellent fluorophores to develop NIR probes. However, the aggregation of cyanine dyes in aqueous solution reduces the utilization of light. To solve this problem, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was introduced into the probes to reduce their aggregation. In our work, two new NIR probes G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> were designed and prepared by conjugating the cyanine dye G<sub>0</sub> with Biotin-PEG5-Azide. The conjugated biotin could enhance the target specificity of probes. And the photophysical and photochemical parameters demonstrated that G<sub>1</sub> and G<sub>2</sub> had a reduced aggregation tendency. In vitro fluorescence imaging proved that these two probes could be specifically taken up by HeLa cells, and in vivo imaging demonstrated that these two probes could specifically target tumors with large tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios.

Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on four cyanine dyes: pseudoisocyanine chloride (PIC), pinacyanol chloride (PCYN), 5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine chloride (TTBC) and 1,1'-disulfopropyl-3,3'-diethyl-5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-benzimidazolylcarbocyanine sodium salt (BIC). Simulations employed an optimised general AMBER force field and demonstrate the organisation of the dyes into stacked structures at dilute concentrations. The thermodynamics of self-assembly was studied by calculating potentials of mean force for n-mers (n = 2, 3 or 4), from which the free energies of association are determined. We report binding free energies in the range of 8 to 15k<sub>B</sub>T for dimerisation, concordant with typical values for ionic chromonics (7 to 14k<sub>B</sub>T), and examine the enthalpic and entropic contributions to the aggregation process. The self-assembly of these dyes yields two distinct classes of structures. We observe the formation of H-aggregate stacks for PCYN, with further complexity in these assemblies for PIC; where the aggregates contain shift and Y junction defects. TTBC and BIC associate into a J-aggregate sheet structure of unimolecular thickness, and is composed of a brickwork arrangement between molecules. These sheet structures are characteristic of the smectic chromonic mesophase, and such assemblies provide a route to the emergence of nanoscale tubular architectures.",,,,,
33466522,Lab-on-Microsphere-FRET-Based Multiplex Sensor Platform.,Here we report on the development and investigation of a novel multiplex assay model based on polymer microspheres (PMS) encoded with ternary AIS/ZnS quantum dots (QDs). The system was prepared via layer-by-layer deposition technique. Our studies of Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the QD-encoded microspheres and two different cyanine dyes have demonstrated that the QD photoluminescence (PL) quenching steadily increases with a decrease in the QD-dye distance. We have found that the sensitized dye PL intensity demonstrates a clear maximum at two double layers of polyelectrolytes between QDs and Dye molecules on the polymer microspheres. Time resolved PL measurements have shown that the PL lifetime decreases for the QDs and increases for the dyes due to FRET. The designed system makes it possible to record spectrally different bands of FRET-induced dye luminescence with different decay times and thereby allows for the multiplexing by wavelength and photoluminescence lifetimes of the dyes. We believe that PMS encoded with AIS/ZnS QDs have great potential for the development of new highly selective and sensitive sensor systems for multiplex analysis to detect cell lysates and body fluids' representative biomarkers.,,,,,

Here, modularly designed peptide-cyanine conjugates that intracellularly self-assembly into 1D columnar superstructures with controlled cyanine aggregation were designed, and they exhibit distinct imaging or photothermal properties. The peptide backbone is cleaved by caspase-3/7 after entering the cells. Then the self-assembled residue, with a double cyanine substitution (Pr-2Cy), forms a P helical column in which H-aggregated cyanine dyes show 3.4-fold photothermal conversion efficiency compared to free ones. The self-assembled residue with a single cyanine substitution (Pr-1Cy) forms a loose column, in which cyanine dyes with undefined structure have a fluorescence quantum yield of up to 9.5 % (emission at 819 nm in H<sub>2</sub> O).

Despite quite intensive studies of ternary QDs over the last years, the specific relaxation channels involved in their emission mechanisms are still poorly understood, particularly in the corresponding core-shell nanostructures. In the present work, we have studied the recombination pathways of AgInS<sub>2</sub> QDs stabilized with the ZnAgInS alloy layer and the ZnS shell (AIS/ZAIS/ZnS QDs) using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. We have also investigated FRET in complexes of AIS/ZAIS/ZnS QDs and cyanine dyes with the absorption bands overlapping in the different regions of the QD emission spectrum, which allowed us to selectively quench the radiative transitions of the QDs. Our studies have demonstrated that FRET from QDs to dyes results in decreasing of all QD PL decay components with the shortest lifetime decreasing the most and the longest one decreasing the least. This research presents important approaches for the investigation of ternary QD luminescence mechanisms by the selective quenching of recombination pathways. These studies are also essential for potential applications of ternary QDs in photodynamic therapy, multiplex analysis, and time-resolved FRET sensing.",,,,,
33289387,Supramolecularly Engineered J-Aggregates Based on Perylene Bisimide Dyes.,"The discovery of the self-assembly of cyanine dyes into J-aggregates had a major impact on the development of dye chemistry due to the emergence of new useful properties in the aggregated state. The unique optical features of these J-aggregates are narrowed, bathochromically shifted absorption bands with almost resonant fluorescence with an increased radiative rate that results from the coherently coupled molecular transition dipoles arranged in a slip-stacked fashion. Because of their desirable properties, J-aggregates gained popularity in the field of functional materials and enabled the efficient photosensitization of silver halide grains in color photography. However, despite a good theoretical understanding of structure-property relationships by the molecular exciton model, further examples of J-aggregates remained scarce for a long time as supramolecular designs to guide the formation of dye aggregates into the required slip-stacked arrangement were lacking.Drawing inspiration from the bacteriochlorophyll <i>c</i> self-organization found in the chlorosomal light-harvesting antennas of green sulfur bacteria, we envisioned the use of nature's supramolecular blueprint to develop J-aggregates of perylene bisimides (PBIs). This class of materials is applied in high-performance color pigments and as n-type organic semiconductors in transistors and solar cells. Combining outstanding photochemical and thermal stability, high tinctorial strength and excellent fluorescence, PBIs are therefore an ideal model system for the preparation of J-aggregates with a wide range of potential applications.In this Account, we elucidate how a combination of steric constraints and hydrogen bonding receptor sites can guide the self-assembly of PBI dyes into slip-stacked packing motifs with J-type exciton coupling. We will discuss the supramolecular polymerization of multiple hydrogen-bonded PBI strands in organic and aqueous media and how minor structural modifications in monomeric PBI molecules can be used to obtain near-infrared absorbing J-aggregates, organogels, or thermoresponsive hydrogels. Pushing the boundaries of self-assembly into the bulk, engineering of the substituents' steric requirements by a dendron-wedge approach afforded adjustable numbers of helical strands of PBI J-aggregates in the columnar liquid-crystalline state and the preparation of lamellar phases. To fully explore their potential, we have studied PBI J-aggregates in collaborative work with spectroscopists, physicists, and theoreticians. In this way, exciton migration over distances of up to 180 nm was shown, and insights into the influence of static disorder on the transport of excitation energy in PBI J-aggregates were derived. Furthermore, the application of PBI J-aggregates as functional materials was demonstrated in photonic microcavities, thin-film transistors, and organic solar cells.",,,,,
33278763,Exploiting the potential of 2D DIGE and 2DE immunoblotting for comparative analysis of crude extract of Trichinella britovi and Trichinella spiralis muscle larvae proteomes.,"The Trichinella genus poses an interesting puzzle for researchers, having diverged very early in the evolution of the nematodes. The Trichinella spiralis proteome is a cosmopolitan and well-studied model of Trichinella; however, Trichinella britovi also circulates in the sylvatic environment and both species infect humans, resulting in the development of trichinellosis. Few experiments have examined the proteins belonging to the T. britovi proteome. The aim of the present study was to compare the protein expression profiles of crude extracts of T. spiralis and T. britovi muscle larvae using a highly-sensitive two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) technique coupled with 2DE immunoblotting. Selected immunoreactive protein spots were then identified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry analysis (LC-MS/MS), and their function in Trichinella and the host-parasite interaction was determined by gene ontology analysis. Spots common to both T. spiralis and T. britovi, spots with different expressions between the two and spots specific to each species were labelled with different cyanine dyes. In total, 196 protein spots were found in both proteomes; of these 165 were common, 23 expressed exclusively in T. spiralis and 8 in T. britovi. A comparative analysis of volume ratio values with Melanie software showed that among the common spots, nine demonstrated higher expression in T. spiralis, and 17 in T. britovi. LC-MS/MS analysis of 11 selected spots identified 41 proteins with potential antigenic characteristics: 26 were specific for T. spiralis, six for T. britovi, and eight were found in both proteomes. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the identified T. spiralis proteins possess hydrolytic endopeptidase, endonuclease and transferase activities. Similarly, most of the T. britovi proteins possess catalytic activities, such as lyase, hydrolase, isomerase and peptidase activity. The applied 2D DIGE technique visualized Trichinella spp. protein spots with different molecular weights or isoelectric point values, as well as those with different expression levels. The identified immunoreactive proteins participate in multiple processes associated with host muscle cell invasion and larval adaptation to the host environment. Their reactivity with the host immune system makes them possible candidates for the development of a novel trichinellosis diagnostic test or vaccine against helminthiasis caused by T. spiralis or T. britovi.",,,"Animals, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Helminth Proteins, Immunoblotting, Muscle, Skeletal, Proteome, Swine, Transcriptome, Trichinella",,
35514896,"Unspecified verticality of Franck-Condon transitions, absorption and emission spectra of cyanine dyes, and a classically inspired approximation.","The computed vertical energy, <i>E</i> <sub>v,a/f</sub>, from the equilibrium geometry of the initial electronic state is frequently considered as representative of the experimental excitation/emission energy, <i>E</i> <sub>abs/fl</sub> = <i>hc</i>/<i>λ</i> <sub>max</sub>. Application of the quantum mechanical version of the Franck-Condon principle does not involve precise specification of nuclear positions before, after, or during an electronic transition. Moreover, the duration of an electronic transition is not experimentally accessible in spectra with resolved vibrational structure. It is shown that computed vibronic spectra based on TDDFT methods and application of quantum mechanical FC analysis predict <i>E</i> <sub>abs</sub> = <i>hc</i>/<i>λ</i> <sub>max</sub> with a 10-fold improvement in accuracy compared to <i>E</i> <sub>v,a</sub> for nine cyanine dyes. It is argued that part of the reason for accuracy when this FC analysis is compared to experiment as opposed to <i>E</i> <sub>v,a/f</sub> is the unspecified verticality of transitions in the context of the quantum version of the FC principle. Classical FC transitions that preserve nuclear kinetic energy before and after an electronic transition were previously found to occur at a weighted average of final and initial electronic state molecular geometries known as the r-centroid. Inspired by this approach a qualitative method using computed vertical and adiabatic energies and the harmonic approximation is developed and applied yielding a 5-fold improvement in accuracy compared to <i>E</i> <sub>v,a</sub>. This improvement results from the dominance of low frequency vibronic transitions in the cyanine dye major band. The model gives insight into the nature of the redshift when qPCR dye EvaGreen is complexed to λDNA and is applicable to the low frequency band of similar non cyanine dyes such as curcumin. It is found that the computed vibronic cyanine dye spectra from time-dependent FC analysis at 0 K and 298 K show decreased intensity at higher temperature suggestive of increased intensity with restricted motion shown when cyanine dyes are used in biomedical imaging. A 2-layer ONIOM model of the DNA minor groove indicates restricted motion of the TC-1 dye excited state in this setting indicative of enhanced fluorescence.",,,,,
33228992,Smart J-aggregate of cyanine photosensitizer with the ability to target tumor and enhance photodynamic therapy efficacy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been demonstrated to be effective for cancer treatment. Design of photosensitizers (PS) featuring tumor targeting, long excitation wavelengths, and high singlet oxygen quantum yields (Φ(<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>)) is the crucial point of highly efficient PDT. However, it is especially difficult to integrate above features into one photosensitizer. Herein, we put forwards a PS J-aggregation method, simultaneously endowing PS with the ability of tumor targeting, the red-shift of spectra, and the increase of Φ(<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>). Cyanine PS 4-((E)-3-((E)-5-iodo-1,3,3-trimethylindolin-2-ylidene)prop-1-en-1-yl)-1-methylquinolin-1-ium iodide (IDMQ) is firstly designed and synthesized by us. IDMQ can form smart response-type J-aggregates under the control of negatively charge in microenvironments. In blood, IDMQ J-aggregates target tumor via ""enhanced permeability and retention (EPR)"" effect. Then the intracellular IDMQ J-aggregates assembled by RNA facilitate the red shift of absorption peak with deeper penetration, and compared to free state IDMQ, improve the Φ(<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>), resulting in the bathochromic shift of optimal PDT wavelength from 630 (free state IDMQ) to 700 nm (IDMQ J-aggregates). This intelligent J-aggregation method establishes a promising way for endowing photosensitizer with the ability of tumor-targeting and the synchronous improvement of PDT efficacy and further boosts the development of PDT.",,,"Humans, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Quinolines, Singlet Oxygen, Tumor Microenvironment",,

33173600,Near-Infrared Activated Cyanine Dyes As Agents for Photothermal Therapy and Diagnosis of Tumors.,"Today, it has become apparent that innovative treatment methods, including those involving simultaneous diagnosis and therapy, are particularly in demand in modern cancer medicine. The development of nanomedicine offers new ways of increasing the therapeutic index and minimizing side effects. The development of photoactivatable dyes that are effectively absorbed in the first transparency window of biological tissues (700-900 nm) and are capable of fluorescence and heat generation has led to the emergence of phototheranostics, an approach that combines the bioimaging of deep tumors and metastases and their photothermal treatment. The creation of near-infrared (NIR) light-activated agents for sensitive fluorescence bioimaging and phototherapy is a priority in phototheranostics, because the excitation of drugs and/or diagnostic substances in the near-infrared region exhibits advantages such as deep penetration into tissues and a weak baseline level of autofluorescence. In this review, we focus on NIR-excited dyes and discuss prospects for their application in photothermal therapy and the diagnosis of cancer. Particular attention is focused on the consideration of new multifunctional nanoplatforms for phototheranostics which allow one to achieve a synergistic effect in combinatorial photothermal, photodynamic, and/or chemotherapy, with simultaneous fluorescence, acoustic, and/or magnetic resonance imaging.",,,,,
33169870,Synthesis of novel cyanine dyes as antitumor agents.,"In this study, some novel cyanine dyes, 1, 3, and 5-15, were synthesized by a one-pot step reaction of pyridinium salts 2 and/or 4 with benzenaminium salt 1. N-{[1-Chloro-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-2-yl)methylene]benzenaminium} chloride 1 was obtained by the reaction of α-tetralone with Vilsmeier-Haack reagent, followed by a mixture of an equimolar ratio of anilin/ethanol (1:1). All new cyanine dyes were evaluated in vitro for their anticancer activity against two cell lines, that is, HepG2 (human hepatocellular liver carcinoma) and MCF-7 (breast cancer). The obtained results were compared with human lung fibroblasts (WI-38) and Vero cells (derived from the kidney of an African green monkey) as normal cells. In particular, some of these compounds, 6, 9, 13, and 14, were found to be the most potent derivatives against all the cancer cell lines, without effect on the normal cells. According to the structure-activity relationship, compound 13 (IC<sub>50</sub>  = 8.8 µg/ml) exhibited a higher activity against HepG2 cells, as it contains the azo group and two phenyl rings and due to the presence of the π-conjugated system attached to the two pyridine rings. Compound 6 (IC<sub>50</sub>  = 8 µg/ml) exhibited a higher activity against MCF-7 cells, as it contains two chlorine atoms and the π-conjugated system of the pyridine rings.",,,"Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Cell Proliferation, Chlorocebus aethiops, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor, Humans, Molecular Structure, Structure-Activity Relationship",,

In this work, to further intensify the optical behavior, a tetrahydropyridine ring was used to replace the cyclohexene ring at the center of IR780, forming a cyanine dye Cy-NH with near-infrared emission. Photophysical properties demonstrated that Cy-NH exhibits good optical performance. In particular, Cy-NH contains two functional reaction sites (e.g. Cl and NH sites on the tetrahydropyridine ring) and can be used to construct functional cyanine dyes.

The quinoline analog was significantly more susceptible to aggregation in an aqueous medium, which resulted in induced circular dichroism (ICD; λ = 450-550 nm) recognition between A-T(U) and G-C basepair containing polynucleotides. The benzothiazole-isostere showed pronounced (four-fold) fluorimetric selectivity toward ds-RNA in comparison to any ds-DNA, at variance to its quinoline-analogue fluorescence being weakly selective to GC-DNA.

As a number of publications have reported on the reactivity of DCNP and its derivatives, we compiled some features of this interesting molecule. This article aims to review the preparation of DCNP, its reactivity, and application in heterocyclic and dyes synthesis. In this review, we have provided an overview of recent progress in the chemistry of DCNP and its significance in the synthesis of various classes of heterocyclic compounds and dyes. The unique reactivity of DCNP offers unprecedentedly mild reaction conditions for the generation of versatile cynomethylene dyes from a wide range of precursors, including amines, α-aminocarboxylic acids, their esters, phenols, malononitriles, and azacrown ethers.

32966416,Probing the role of oscillator strength and charge of exciton forming molecular J-aggregates in controlling nanoscale plasmon-exciton interactions.,"In this study, we probe into the roles of exciton oscillator strength and charge of J-aggregates as well as nanoparticle's surface capping ligands in dictating the plasmon-exciton interaction. We systematically compare the plasmon-exciton coupling strengths of two hybrid plexcitonic systems involving CTAB-capped hollow gold nanoprisms (HGNs) and two different cyanine dyes, TDBC and PIC, having very similar J-band spectral positions and linewidths, but different oscillator strengths and opposite charges. Both HGN-PIC and HGN-TDBC systems display large Rabi splitting energies which are found to be extremely dependent on dye-concentrations. Interestingly, for our plexciton systems we find that there is interplay between the exciton oscillator strength and the electrostatic interaction amid dyes and HGN-surfaces in dictating the coupling strength. The oscillator strength dominates at low dye-concentrations resulting in larger Rabi splitting in the HGN-PIC system while at high concentrations, a favorable electrostatic interaction between TDBC and CTAB-capped HGN results in larger exciton population of the HGN-surface and in turn larger Rabi splitting for the HGN-TDBC system than the HGN-PIC system even though TDBC has a lower oscillator strength than PIC. The trend in Rabi splitting is just reversed when the HGN surface is modified with a negatively charged polymer, confirming the role of electrostatic interactions in influencing the plasmon-exciton coupling strength.",,,,,

32949719,"Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel heptamethine cyanine dye-erlotinib conjugates as antitumor agents.","Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR-TK) has been proved as a target for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with specific gene mutations. However, EGFR-TK inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) need to enter cancer cells and then competitively interact with the active site of tyrosine kinase receptors to suppress the downstream signaling pathway to inhibit tumor proliferation. In this study, in order to improve the tumor cell targeting ability of EGFR-TKI, EGFR-TKI erlotinib was conjugated with the cancer cell-targeting heptamethine cyanine dyes to form seventeen novel erlotinib-dye conjugates. The efficiency of tumor targeting properties of conjugates against cancer cell growth and EGFR-TK inhibition was evaluated in vitro. The result revealed that most erlotinib-dye conjugates exhibited stronger inhibitory effect on A549, H460, H1299 and MDA-MB-231 cell lines than the parent drug erlotinib. Meanwhile, representative compounds exhibited weak cytotoxicity on human normal mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells. Moreover, the conjugate CE17 also showed ~14-fold higher EGFR-TK inhibition activity (IC<sub>50</sub> = 0.124 μM) than erlotinib (IC<sub>50</sub> = 5.182 μM) in A549 cell line. Finally, molecular docking analysis verified that the erlotinib moiety of compound CE17 could form hydrogen bond with Met-769 and occupy active cavity of EGFR-TK. Therefore, we believed the integration strategy between heptamethine cyanine dyes and EGFR-TKI will contribute to enhancing the therapeutic effect of EGFR-TKI for NSCLC treatment.",,,"Antineoplastic Agents, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Drug Design, Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor, ErbB Receptors, Erlotinib Hydrochloride, Humans, Indoles, Molecular Docking Simulation, Molecular Structure, Protein Binding, Protein Kinase Inhibitors, Structure-Activity Relationship",,

The MIS should be introducible into biomolecules of choice via an efficient and chemoselective click chemistry reaction. After chemical optimization, a successful synthetic strategy towards such hybrid MIS was developed, based on solid phase-based synthesis techniques and applying different near-infrared fluorescent cyanine dyes. The developed hybrid agents were shown to be easily introducible into a model homobivalent peptidic gastrin-releasing peptide receptor- (GRPR)-specific carrier without forming any side products and the MIS as well as their bioconjugates were radiolabeled with the positron-emitter <sup>68</sup>Ga<sup>3+</sup>. The hybrid multimodal agents were characterized with regard to their log<i><sub>D</sub></i>s, GRPR target affinities and photophysical characteristics. It could be shown that the properties of the bioconjugates were not per se affected by the introduction of the MIS but that the cyanine dye used and specifically the number of comprised negative charges per dye molecule can have a considerable influence on target receptor binding. Thus, the molecular toolbox described here enables the synthesis of tailored hybrid multimodal imaging synthons for biomolecule modification, meeting the specific need and envisioned application of the combined imaging agent.",,,,,

Specifically, in the framework of single-determinant Hartree-Fock or density functional methods for a resonance-stabilized molecule or supramolecular complex, we employ NBO/NRT descriptors of the ground-state determinant to develop a qualitative picture of the associated charge-transfer excitation that dominates the valence region of the electronic spectrum. We illustrate the procedure for the elementary bond shifts of S<sub>N</sub>2-type halide exchange reaction as well as the more complex bond shifts in a series of conjugated cyanine dyes. In each case, we show how NBO-based descriptors of resonance-type 3-center, 4-electron (3c/4e) interactions provide simple estimates of spectroscopic excitation energy, bond orders, and other vibronic details of the excited-state PES that anticipate important features of the full multi-configuration description. The deep 3c/4e connections to measurable spectral properties also provide evidence for NBO-based estimates of ground-state donor-acceptor stabilization energies (sometimes criticized as ""too large"" compared to alternative analysis methods) that are also found to be of proper magnitude to provide useful estimates of excitation energies and structure-dependent spectral shifts.",,,"Carbocyanines, Models, Molecular, Spectrum Analysis, Thermodynamics",,
32876461,Thermodynamic Control over Molecular Aggregate Assembly Enables Tunable Excitonic Properties across the Visible and Near-Infrared.,"Specific molecular arrangements within H-/J-aggregates of cyanine dyes enable extraordinary photophysical properties, including long-range exciton delocalization, extreme blue/red shifts, and excitonic superradiance. Despite extensive literature on cyanine aggregates, design principles that drive the self-assembly to a preferred H- or J-aggregated state are unknown. We tune the thermodynamics of self-assembly via independent control of the solvent/nonsolvent ratio, ionic strength, or dye concentration, obtaining a broad range of conditions that predictably stabilize the monomer (H-/J-aggregate). Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy together reveal a dynamic equilibrium between monomers, H-aggregated dimers, and extended J-aggregated 2D monolayers. We construct a model that predicts the equilibrium composition for a range of standard Gibbs free energies, providing a vast aggregation space which we access using the aforementioned solvation factors. We demonstrate the universality of this approach among several sheet-forming cyanine dyes with tunable absorptions spanning visible, near, and shortwave infrared wavelengths.",,,,,
32874638,Far-red pentamethine cyanine dyes as fluorescent probes for the detection of serum albumins.,"Benzothiazole based cyanine dyes with bridged groups in the pentamethine chain were studied as potential far-red fluorescent probes for protein detection. Spectral-luminescent properties were characterized for unbound dyes and in the presence of serum albumins (bovine (BSA), human (HSA), equine (ESA)), and globular proteins (β-lactoglobulin, ovalbumin). We have observed that the addition of albumins leads to a significant increase in dyes fluorescence intensity. However, the fluorescent response of dyes in the presence of other globular proteins was notably lower. The value of fluorescence quantum yield for dye bearing a sulfonate group complexed with HSA amounted to 42% compared with 0.2% for the free dye. The detection limit of HSA by this dye was greater than 0.004 mg ml<sup>-1</sup> which indicates the high sensitivity of dye to low HSA concentrations. Modelling of structure of the dyes complexes with albumin molecules was performed by molecular docking. According to these data, dyes could bind to up to five sites on the HSA molecule; the most preferable are the haemin-binding site in subdomain IB and the dye-binding site in the pocket between subdomains IA, IIA and IIIA. This work confirms that pentamethine cyanine dyes could be proposed as powerful far-red fluorescent probes applicable for highly sensitive detection of albumins.",,,,,

32785050,Spectral-Time Multiplexing in FRET Complexes of AgInS<sub>2</sub>/ZnS Quantum Dot and Organic Dyes.,"Nowadays, multiplex analysis is very popular, since it allows to detect a large number of biomarkers simultaneously. Traditional multiplex analysis is usually based on changes of photoluminescence (PL) intensity and/or PL band spectral positions in the presence of analytes. Using PL lifetime as an additional parameter might increase the efficiency of multiplex methods. Quantum dots (QDs) can be used as luminescent markers for multiplex analysis. Ternary in-based QDs are a great alternative to the traditional Cd-based one. Ternary QDs possess all advantages of traditional QDs, including tunable photoluminescence in visible range. At the same time ternary QDs do not have Cd-toxicity, and moreover they possess long spectral dependent lifetimes. This allows the use of ternary QDs as a donor for time-resolved multiplex sensing based on Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). In the present work, we implemented FRET from AgInS<sub>2</sub>/ZnS ternary QDs to cyanine dyes absorbing in different spectral regions of QD luminescence with different lifetimes. As the result, FRET-induced luminescence of dyes differed not only in wavelengths but also in lifetimes of luminescence, which can be used for time-resolved multiplex analysis in biology and medicine.",,,,,

32761557,Virus-Mimicking Nanoparticles for Targeted Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Intraperitoneal Ovarian Tumors in Mice.,"Ovarian cancer is the most lethal malignancy affecting the female reproductive system. Identification and removal of all ovarian intraperitoneal tumor deposits during the intraoperative surgery is important towards preventing cancer recurrence and ultimately improving patient survival. Herein, we investigate the effectiveness of virus mimicking nanoparticles, derived from genome-depleted plant-infecting brome mosaic virus, and doped with near infrared (NIR) brominated cyanine dye BrCy106-NHS, for targeted NIR fluorescence imaging of intraperitoneal ovarian tumors. We refer to these nanoparticles as optical viral ghosts (OVGs). We functionalized the OVGs with antibodies against HER2 receptor, a biomarker over-expressed in ovarian cancers. We injected functionalized OVGs, non-functionalized OVGs, and non-encapsulated BrCy106-NHS intravenously in mice implanted with ovarian intraperitoneal tumors. Tumors were extracted at 2, 6, and 24 h post-injection, and quantitatively analyzed using NIR fluorescence imaging. Fluorescence emission from tumors associated with the injection of the functionalized OVGs continued to increase between 2 and 24 h post-injection. At 24 h timepoint, the average spectrally-integrated fluorescence emission from homogenized tumors containing functionalized-OVGs was about 3.5 and 19.5 times higher than those containing non-functionalized OVGs or non-encapsulated BrCy106-NHS, respectively. Similarly, by using the functionalized-OVGs, the imaging signal-to-noise ratio at 24 h timepoint was enhanced by approximately threefold and sevenfold as compared to non-functionalized OVGs and the non-encapsulated dye, respectively. These functionalized virus-mimicking NIR nano-constructs could potentially be used for intraoperative visualization of ovarian tumors implants.",,,"Animals, Bromovirus, Cell Line, Tumor, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Mice, Nude, Nanoparticles, Optical Imaging, Ovarian Neoplasms, Peritoneal Neoplasms, Receptor, ErbB-2, Transplantation, Heterologous, Mice",,

32662175,Aggregation-Induced Emission (AIE): A Historical Perspective.,"Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has attracted considerable interest over the last twenty years. In contrast to the large number of available reviews focusing specifically on AIE, this Essay discusses the AIE phenomenon from a broader perspective, with an emphasis on early observations related to AIE made long before the term was coined. Illustrative examples are highlighted from the 20th century where fluorescence enhancement upon rigidification of dyes in viscous or solid environments or J-aggregate formation was studied. It is shown that these examples already include typical AIE luminogens such as tetraphenylethylene (TPE) as well as stilbenes and oligo- or polyphenylenevinylenes and -ethynylenes, which became important fluorescent solid-state materials in OLED research in the 1990s. Further examples include cyanine dyes such as thiazole orange (TO) or its dimers (TOTOs), which have been widely applied as molecular probes in nucleic acid research. The up to 10 000-fold fluorescence enhancement of such dyes upon intercalation into double-stranded DNA, attributable to the restricted intramolecular motion (RIM) concept, afforded commercial products for bioimaging and fluorescence sensing applications already in the early 1990s.",,,,,
32640366,Anticancer pentamethinium salt is a potent photosensitizer inducing mitochondrial disintegration and apoptosis upon red light illumination.,"Despite progress in the development and application of novel therapeutic agents, cancer remains a major cause of death worldwide. Therefore, there is a need for new approaches to increase therapeutic options and efficiency. The metabolism of cancer cells differs from that of non-malignant cells and their mitochondria show altered activities that can be utilized as a target for drug development. Salt 1 is a low-molecular weight heterocyclic compound of the polymethine class that accumulates in the mitochondria of cancer cells and selectively disrupts their metabolism. Salt 1 leads to a non-apoptotic form of cell death in vitro that is associated with an autophagic cellular response and eventual metabolic collapse, and inhibits human tumor xenograft growth in vivo without apparent toxicity for normal cells. As a pentamethinium compound, salt 1 exhibits intrinsic fluorescence and is a candidate for photosensitization after excitation by appropriate wavelengths of light. Herein, we report that salt 1 is a potent photosensitizer, which generates a photodynamic effect and provides enhanced cytotoxicity compared to salt 1 without light exposure. Importantly, photosensitization is optimally induced by red light, which is used clinically for photosensitization and penetrates further into tissues than lower wavelengths. Cancer cells treated with non-cytotoxic doses of salt 1 and subsequently exposed to 630 nm light show severely damaged mitochondria, manifested by reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and disintegration of the mitochondrial tubular network. As a consequence, cancer cells lose their proliferative potential and die via apoptosis in the presence of light. These findings indicate that salt 1 is a promising photosensitizer with potential to be combined with 630 nm light to strengthen its efficacy in cancer therapy.",,,"Apoptosis, Bis-Trimethylammonium Compounds, Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Mitochondria, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Reactive Oxygen Species, Salts",,
32630496,DNA Photocleavage in the Near-Infrared Wavelength Range by 2-Quinolinium Dicarbocyanine Dyes.,"Here, we report the syntheses of two pentamethine cyanine dyes containing quinolinium rings and substituted with either hydrogen (<b>3</b>) or bromine (<b>4</b>) at the <i>meso</i> carbon. The electron withdrawing bromine atom stabilizes dye <b>4</b> in aqueous buffer, allowing complex formation to occur between the dye and double-helical DNA. UV-visible, CD, and fluorescence spectra recorded at low DNA concentrations suggest that dye <b>4</b> initially binds to the DNA as a high-order aggregate. As the ratio of DNA to dye is increased, the aggregate is converted to monomeric and other low-order dye forms that interact with DNA in a non-intercalative fashion. The brominated dye <b>4</b> is relatively unreactive in the dark, but, under 707-759 nm illumination, generates hydroxyl radicals that cleave DNA in high yield (pH 7.0, 22 °C). Dye <b>4</b> is also taken up by ES2 ovarian carcinoma cells, where it is non-toxic under dark conditions. Upon irradiation of the ES2 cells at 694 nm, the brominated cyanine reduces cell viability from 100 ± 10% to 14 ± 1%. Our results suggest that 2-quinolinium-based carbocyanine dyes equipped with stabilizing electron withdrawing groups may have the potential to serve as sensitizing agents in long-wavelength phototherapeutic applications.",,,"Apoptosis, Carbocyanines, Cell Proliferation, DNA Cleavage, DNA, Neoplasm, Female, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Ovarian Neoplasms, Photochemistry, Quinolinium Compounds, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Tumor Cells, Cultured",,
32597630,Intriguing H-Aggregates of Heptamethine Cyanine for Imaging-Guided Photothermal Cancer Therapy.,"Organic small-molecule-based photothermal agents such as cyanine dyes have received increasing attention in developing novel cancer therapies with potential clinical utility but suffer from poor stability, low photothermal efficiency, and limited accumulation at tumor sites in molecular forms. Self-assembly of small-molecule dyes into supramolecular assemblies may address these concerns by controlling the molecular organization of dye monomers to form structures of a higher order. Among them, H-aggregates of dyes favor face-to-face contacts with strongly overlapping areas, which always have a negative connotation to exhibit low or no fluorescence in most cases but may emanate energy in nonradiative forms such as heat for photothermal cancer therapy applications. Here, the synergistic self-assembly of cyanine dyes into H-aggregates is developed as a new supramolecular strategy to fabricate small-molecule-based photothermal nanomaterials. Compared to the free cyanine dyes, the H-aggregates assembled from pyrene or tetraphenylethene (TPE) conjugating cyanine exhibit the expected absorption spectral blue shift and fluorescence self-quenching but unique photothermal properties. Remarkably, the obtained H-aggregates are saucer-shaped nanoparticles that exhibit passive tumor-targeting properties to induce imaging-guided photothermal tumor ablation under irradiation. This supramolecular strategy presented herein may open up new opportunities for constructing next-generation small-molecule-based self-assembly nanomaterials for PTT cancer therapy in clinics.",,,"Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Breast Neoplasms, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Mice, Nude, Particle Size, Photothermal Therapy, Pyrenes, Small Molecule Libraries, Stilbenes, Surface Properties",,
32594743,Unifying Mechanism for Thiol-Induced Photoswitching and Photostability of Cyanine Dyes.,"Cyanines (Cy3, Cy5, Cy3B) are the most utilized dyes for single-molecule fluorescence and localization-based super-resolution imaging. These modalities exploit cyanines' versatile photochemical behavior with thiols. A mechanism reconciling seemingly divergent results and enabling control over cyanine photoreactivity is however missing. Utilizing single-molecule fluorescence on Cy5 and Cy5B, transient-absorption spectroscopy, and DFT modeling on a range of cyanine dyes, herein we show that photoinduced electron transfer (P<i>e</i>T) from a thiolate to Cy in their triplet excited state and then triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing in the nascent geminate radical pair are crucial steps. Next, a bifurcation occurs, yielding either back electron transfer and regeneration of ground state Cy, required for photostabilization, or Cy-thiol adduct formation, necessary for super-resolution microscopy. Cy regeneration via photoinduced thiol elimination is favored by adduct absorption spectra broadening. Elimination is also shown to occur through an acid-catalyzed reaction. Overall, our work provides a roadmap for designing fluorophores, photoswitching agents, and triplet excited state quenchers for single-molecule and super-resolution imaging.",,,"Carbocyanines, Density Functional Theory, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Structure, Photochemical Processes, Sulfhydryl Compounds",,
32583632,Ratiometric Nanoparticle Probe Based on FRET-Amplified Phosphorescence for Oxygen Sensing with Minimal Phototoxicity.,"Luminescent oxygen probes enable direct imaging of hypoxic conditions in cells and tissues, which are associated with a variety of diseases, including cancer. Here, a nanoparticle probe that addresses key challenges in the field is developed, it: i) strongly amplifies room temperature phosphorescence of encapsulated oxygen-sensitive dyes; ii) provides ratiometric response to oxygen; and iii) solves the fundamental problem of phototoxicity of phosphorescent sensors. The nanoprobe is based on 40 nm polymeric nanoparticles, encapsulating ≈2000 blue-emitting cyanine dyes with fluorinated tetraphenylborate counterions, which are as bright as 70 quantum dots (QD525). It functions as a light-harvesting nanoantenna that undergoes efficient Förster resonance energy transfer to ≈20 phosphorescent oxygen-sensitive platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) acceptor dyes. The obtained nanoprobe emits stable blue fluorescence and oxygen-sensitive red phosphorescence, providing ratiometric response to dissolved oxygen. The light harvesting leads to ≈60-fold phosphorescence amplification and makes the single nanoprobe particle as bright as ≈1200 PtOEP dyes. This high brightness enables oxygen detection at a single-particle level and in cells at ultra-low nanoprobe concentration with no sign of phototoxicity, in contrast to PtOEP dye. The developed nanoprobe is successfully applied to the imaging of a microfluidics-generated oxygen gradient in cancer cells. It constitutes a promising tool for bioimaging of hypoxia.",,,"Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Nanoparticles, Oxygen, Polymers, Quantum Dots",,

The complex displays efficient energy transfer from the central cyanine dye to the surrounding zinc porphyrin nanoring.

Its applicability and efficiency are closely related to the interaction of three main components, namely a photosensitizer, light and molecular triplet oxygen, which should drive cell death. Recently, several studies have demonstrated that squaraine cyanine dyes have a set of photophysical and photochemical properties that have made of these compounds' potential photosensitizers for this therapeutic modality. In the present research work, we describe the synthesis and characterization of four quinoline‑ and benzoselenazole‑derived unsymmetrical squaraine cyanine dyes. Except for the precursor of aminosquaraine dyes, i.e., <i>O</i>‑methylated derivative, all dyes were evaluated for their behavior and absorption capacity in different organic and aqueous solvents, their ability to form singlet oxygen, their light‑stability, and <i>in vitro</i> phototherapeutic effects against two human breast cancer cell cultures (BT‑474 and MCF‑7). Regardless of the nature of the used solvents, the synthesized dyes showed intense absorption in the red and near‑infrared spectral regions, despite the formation of aggregates in aqueous media.

32514888,In Vivo Evaluation of Indium-111-Labeled 800CW as a Necrosis-Avid Contrast Agent.,"Current clinical measurements for tumor treatment efficiency rely often on changes in tumor volume measured as shrinkage by CT or MRI, which become apparent after multiple lines of treatment and pose a physical and psychological burden on the patient. Detection of therapy-induced cell death in the tumor can be a fast measure for treatment efficiency. However, there are no reliable clinical tools for detection of tumor necrosis. Previously, we studied the necrosis avidity of cyanine-based fluorescent dyes, which suffered long circulation times before tumor necrosis could be imaged due to low hydrophilicity. We now present the application of radiolabeled 800CW, a commercially available cyanine with high hydrophilicity, to image tumor necrosis in a mouse model. We conjugated 800CW to DOTA via a PEG linker, for labeling with single-photon emission-computed tomography isotope indium-111, yielding [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-800CW. We then investigated specific [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-800CW uptake by dead cells in vitro, using both fluorescence and radioactivity as detection modalities. Finally, we investigated [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-800CW uptake into necrotic tumor regions of a 4T1 breast tumor model in mice. We successfully prepared a precursor and developed a reliable procedure for labeling 800CW with indium-111. We detected specific [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-800CW uptake by dead cells, using both fluorescence and radioactivity. Albeit with a tumor uptake of only 0.37%ID/g at 6 h post injection, we were able to image tumor necrosis with a tumor to background ratio of 7:4. Fluorescence and radioactivity in cryosections from the dissected tumors were colocalized with tumor necrosis, confirmed by TUNEL staining. [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-800CW can be used to image tumor necrosis in vitro and in vivo. Further research will elucidate the application of [<sup>111</sup>In]In-DOTA-PEG<sub>4</sub>-800CW or other radiolabeled hydrophilic cyanines for the detection of necrosis caused by chemotherapy or other anti-cancer therapies.

32490191,Constructing a Local Hydrophobic Cage in Dye-Doped Fluorescent Silica Nanoparticles to Enhance the Photophysical Properties.,"Aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ) and poor photostability in aqueous media are two common problems for organic fluorescence dyes which cause a dramatic loss of fluorescence imaging quality and photodynamic therapy (PDT) failure. Herein, a local hydrophobic cage is built up inside near-infrared (NIR) cyanine-anchored fluorescent silica nanoparticles (FSNPs) in which a hydrophobic silane coupling agent (<i>n</i>-octyltriethoxysilane, OTES) is doped into FSNPs for the first time to significantly inhibit the ACQ effect and inward diffusion of water molecules. Therefore, the obtained optimal FSNP-C with OTES-modification can provide hydrophobic repulsive forces to effectively inhibit the π-π stacking interaction of cyanine dyes and simultaneously reduce the formation of strong oxidizing species (•OH and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) in reaction with H<sub>2</sub>O, resulting in the best photostability (fluorescent intensity remained at 90.1% of the initial value after 300 s of laser scanning) and a high PDT efficiency on two- and three-dimensional (spheroids) HeLa cell culture models. Moreover, through molecular engineering (including increasing covalent anchoring sites and steric hindrance groups of cyanine dyes), FSNP-C exhibits the highest fluorescent intensity both in water solution (12.3-fold improvement compared to free dye) and living cells due to the limitation of molecular motion. Thus, this study provides an effectively strategy by combining a local hydrophobic cage and molecular engineering for NIR FSNPs in long-term bright fluorescence imaging and a stable PDT process.",,,,,

Thionation significantly favored the ability to singlet oxygen production, and moderate photostability was observed for squaraine and monothionated dyes. Squaraine and monothiosquaraine cyanine dyes showed high promise within the tested concentration range regarding their potential application as cancer photodynamic therapy photosensitizers.

A series of combinational logic circuits at the molecular level have been constructed, however, the development of sequential logic circuits is still in its infancy due to the lack of ideal design tools. Taking advantage of unique assembly behaviors of cyanine dyes, we constructed a two-bit molecular counter circuit that can implement fundamental sequential logic functions, including number cumulating and descending. Further introducing a guanine-rich DNA strand as the cycle index, the counter can be reused several times and eventually be scaled up to count up to 16 numbers. The supramolecular circuit shows high programmability, flexibility, and reversibility, and it is prospected that the strategy would be applied in designing other advanced molecular circuits.",,,,,

The properties of DMC were compared with those of the previously studied meso-substituted anionic dyes 3,3'-di(γ-sulfopropyl)-4,5,4',5'-dibenzo-9-ethylthiacarbocyanine betaine (DEC), 3,3'-di-(γ-sulfopropyl)-9-methylthiacarbocyanine betaine (MTC) and 3,3'-di-(γ-sulfopropyl)-5,5'-diphenyl-9-ethyloxacarbocyanine betaine (OCC), which were studied here in more detail. In aqueous solutions, DMC, like DEC, is prone to dimerization; it also forms H- and J-aggregates. The noncovalent interaction of DMC with HSA leads to decomposition of the dimers with a shift in the cis-trans isomeric equilibrium toward the trans-monomer complexed with HSA, which is accompanied by a significant increase in fluorescence. The spectral-fluorescent data were used to estimate the binding constants of the dyes with HSA and other characteristics of the dyes, which are important when used as probes for HSA. The effect of structural rearrangements of HSA upon denaturation by urea on the spectral-fluorescent properties of the dyes was studied. Molecular docking of the dye-HSA systems was performed.

PDT requires the application of a photosensitizer (such as: porphyrins, chlorines, and phthalocyanines) that selectively targets malignant cells. It is a dilemma to find a proper photosensitizer. In our study, we have tested a new in-vitro group of cyanine dyes. These dyes are widely applied in biotechnology as fluorescent markers. Two malignant adenocarcinoma cell lines (MCF-7/WT and MCF-7/DOX) were investigated using photodynamic reaction (PDR) with four cyanine dyes (KF-570, HM-118, FBF-749, and ER-139). KF-570 and HM-118 were irradiated with red light (630 nm), whereas FBF-749 and ER-139 with green light (435 nm). To evaluate PDR efficiency, a clonogenic test was conducted. Apoptosis was investigated by TUNEL and NCA (neutral comet) assays. Proteins selected as indicators of the apoptotic pathway (AIF, sPLA2, Smac/Diablo) and intracellular response markers (SOD-1 and GST-pi) were detected using western blot. The highest number of apoptotic cells (ca. 100%) was observed after PDR with HM-118 and KF-570 in both conducted tests, in both cell lines. The results showed that HM-118 and KF-570 cyanine dyes demonstrated a major phototoxic effect causing apoptosis in doxorubicin-resistant and sensitive cell lines.",,,"Apoptosis, Breast Neoplasms, Carbocyanines, Caspase 3, Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, MCF-7 Cells, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents",,

However, dye instability, aggregation, and poor pharmacokinetics are current drawbacks that limit performance and the scope of possible applications. All these limitations are simultaneously overcome with a new molecular design strategy that produces a charge balanced and sterically shielded fluorochrome. The key design feature is a meso-aryl group that simultaneously projects two shielding arms directly over each face of a linear heptamethine polyene.

32301458,Targeted nanocarriers based on iodinated-cyanine dyes as immunomodulators for synergistic phototherapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT), as one of the most powerful photo-therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment with minimum invasiveness, can effectively damage local tumor cells and significantly induce systemic antitumor immunity. However, current nanotechnology-assisted PDT-immunomodulators have either poor penetration for deep tumors or low singlet oxygen generation. Herein, we construct a novel theranostic nanocarrier (HA-PEG-CyI, HPC) by inducing the self-assembly of PEGylated CyI and attaching the ligand HA to its surface. The prepared HPC can be used as an ideal PDT-immunomodulator for synergistic cancer therapy. CyI is an iodinated-cyanine dye with enhanced singlet oxygen generation ability as well as excellent photo-to-photothermal and near-infrared fluorescence imaging properties. Under 808 nm laser irradiation, the prepared HPC can generate both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elevate temperature which can subsequently result in apoptosis and necrosis at tumor sites. Moreover, the HPC-induced cell death can generate a series of acute inflammatory reactions, leading to systemic immunity induction and secondary death of tumor cells, which further results in reducing tumor recurrence. In vitro and in vivo results show that HPC can enhance the tumor targeting efficacy, generate ROS efficiently and exhibit a high temperature response under NIR irradiation, which working together can activate immune responses for synergistic phototherapy on tumor cells. Accordingly, the proposed multi-functional HPC nanocarriers represent an important advance in PDT and can be used as a superior cancer treatment strategy with great promise for clinical applications.",,,"Animals, Apoptosis, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Drug Carriers, Female, Humans, Hydrocarbons, Iodinated, Immunologic Factors, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Nanostructures, Neoplasms, Experimental, Photochemotherapy, RAW 264.7 Cells",,

32216369,Fluorescence-Detected Conformational Changes in Duplex DNA in Open Complex Formation by <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA Polymerase: Upstream Wrapping and Downstream Bending Precede Clamp Opening and Insertion of the Downstream Duplex.,"FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) between far-upstream (-100) and downstream (+14) cyanine dyes (Cy3, Cy5) showed extensive bending and wrapping of λP<sub>R</sub> promoter DNA on <i>Escherichia coli</i> RNA polymerase (RNAP) in closed and open complexes (CC and OC, respectively). Here we determine the kinetics and mechanism of DNA bending and wrapping by FRET and of formation of RNAP contacts with -100 and +14 DNA by single-dye protein-induced fluorescence enhancement (PIFE). FRET and PIFE kinetics exhibit two phases: rapidly reversible steps forming a CC ensemble ({CC}) of four intermediates [initial (RP<sub>C</sub>), early (I<sub>1E</sub>), mid (I<sub>1M</sub>), and late (I<sub>1L</sub>)], followed by conversion of {CC} to OC via I<sub>1L</sub>. FRET and PIFE are first observed for I<sub>1E</sub>, not RP<sub>c</sub>. FRET and PIFE together reveal large-scale bending and wrapping of upstream and downstream DNA as RP<sub>C</sub> advances to I<sub>1E</sub>, decreasing the Cy3-Cy5 distance to ∼75 Å and making RNAP-DNA contacts at -100 and +14. We propose that far-upstream DNA wraps on the upper β'-clamp while downstream DNA contacts the top of the β-pincer in I<sub>1E</sub>. Converting I<sub>1E</sub> to I<sub>1M</sub> (∼1 s time scale) reduces FRET efficiency with little change in -100 or +14 PIFE, interpreted as clamp opening that moves far-upstream DNA (on β') away from downstream DNA (on β) to increase the Cy3-Cy5 distance by ∼14 Å.

32195576,Fluorescent Aminoglycoside Antibiotics and Methods for Accurately Monitoring Uptake by Bacteria.,"Characterizing how multidrug-resistant bacteria circumvent the action of clinically used or novel antibiotics requires a detailed understanding of how the antibiotics interact with and cross bacterial membranes to accumulate in the cells and exert their action. When monitoring the interactions of drugs with bacteria, it remains challenging to differentiate functionally relevant internalized drug levels from nonspecific binding. Fluorescence is a method of choice for observing dynamics of biomolecules. In order to facilitate studies involving aminoglycoside antibiotics, we have generated fluorescently labeled aminoglycoside derivatives with uptake and bactericidal activities similar, albeit with a moderate loss, to those of the parent drug. The method combines fluorescence microscopy with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using neomycin coupled to nonpermeable cyanine dyes. Fluorescence imaging allowed membrane-bound antibiotic to be distinguished from molecules in the cytoplasm. Patterns of uptake were assigned to different populations in the FACS analysis. Our study illustrates how fluorescent derivatives of an aminoglycoside enable a robust characterization of the three components of uptake: membrane binding, EDPI, and EDPII. Because EDPI levels are weak compared to the two other types of accumulation and critical for the action of these drugs, the three components of uptake must be taken into account separately when drawing conclusions about aminoglycoside function.",,,"Aminoglycosides, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Bacteria, Coloring Agents, Flow Cytometry, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Neomycin",,
35021648,Evaluating the Photodynamic Biocidal Activity and Investigating the Mechanism of Thiazolium Cyanine Dyes.,"In order to develop ideal photosensitizers for photodynamic therapy (PDT), a thiazolium group was introduced in cyanine dyes to possess the advantages of intense absorption in the visible region and anti-microbial activity. We evaluated the anti-bacterial activity of the three thiazolium cyanine dyes against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (Gram-positive bacteria) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> (Gram-negative bacteria) <i>in vitro</i>. This is the first time that such kinds of cyanine dyes are applied in the photodynamic antibiotic area. Cyanines display excellent anti-bacterial activity to <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i> exposed to white light irradiation, and the corresponding light-induced biocidal efficacy of cyanines increased with irradiation time and concentration. At the same time, there was no observation of dark anti-bacterial abilities. Especially, cyanines show low cell cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility. These results suggest that thiazolium cyanine could work as a photosensitizer in PDT with great promise and broad applications for killing bacteria. Mechanistic studies suggest that the reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the vital factor for combating bacteria exposure to white light conditions, whereas it is not the only determining factor of the biocidal activity. The interaction of the cyanine to the cell membrane also plays a critical role in killing bacteria, which has exhibited a synergic effect of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. It influences the cell uptake and the membrane perturbation activity of the cyanines, which indirectly affects the biocidal activity.",,,,,
32105698,Small ultra-red fluorescent protein nanoparticles as exogenous probes for noninvasive tumor imaging in vivo.,"Nanoparticles are excellent imaging agents for cancer, but variability in chemical structure, racemic mixtures, and addition of heavy metals hinders FDA approval in the United States. We developed a small ultra-red fluorescent protein, named smURFP, to have optical properties similar to the small-molecule Cy5, a heptamethine subclass of cyanine dyes (Ex/Em = 642/670 nm). smURFP has a fluorescence quantum yield of 18% and expresses so well in E. coli, that gram quantities of fluorescent protein are purified from cultures in the laboratory. In this research, the fluorescent protein smURFP was combined with bovine serum albumin into fluorescent protein nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are fluorescent with a quantum yield of 17% and 12-14 nm in diameter. The far-red fluorescent protein nanoparticles noninvasively image tumors in living mice via the enhanced permeation and retention (EPR) mechanism. This manuscript describes the use of a new fluorescent protein nanoparticle for in vivo fluorescent imaging. This protein nanoparticle core should prove useful as a biomacromolecular scaffold, which could bear extended chemical modifications for studies, such as the in vivo imaging of fluorescent protein nanoparticles targeted to primary and metastatic cancer, theranostic treatment, and/or dual-modality imaging with positron emission tomography for entire human imaging.",,,"A549 Cells, Animals, Fluorescent Dyes, Heterografts, Humans, Luminescent Proteins, Lung Neoplasms, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Nanoparticles, Neoplasm Transplantation, Optical Imaging, Red Fluorescent Protein",,
32104501,Glutathione-responsive disassembly of disulfide dicyanine for tumor imaging with reduction in background signal intensity.,"Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging has been proved as an effective modality in identifying the tumor border and distinguishing the tumor cells from healthy tissue during the oncological surgery. Developing NIR fluorescent probes with high tumor to background (T/B) signal is essential for the complete debulking of the tumor, which will prolong the survival rate of tumor patients. However, the nonspecific binding and ""always-on"" properties of the conventional fluorescent probes leads to high background signals and poor specificity. <b>Method</b>: To address this problem, glutathione (GSH)-responsive, two disulfide-bonded dicyanine dyes (<b>ss-diCy5</b> and <b>ss-diNH800CW</b>) were synthesized. As synthesized dyes are quenched under normal physiological conditions, however, once reached to the tumor site, these dyes are capable of emitting strong fluorescence signals primarily because of the cleavage of the disulfide bond in the tumor microenvironment with high GSH concentration. Besides, the GSH-responsive behavior of these dyes was monitored using the UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. The diagnostic accuracy of the aforementioned dyes was also tested both in tumor cells and 4T1-bearing mice. <b>Results</b>: The fluorescence signal intensity of disulfide dicyanine dyes was quenched up to 89% compared to the mono cyanine dyes, thus providing a very low fluorescence background. However, when the disulfide dicyanine dye reaches the tumor site, the dicyanine is cleaved by GSH into two mono-dyes with high fluorescence strength, thus producing strong fluorescent signals upon excitation. The fluorescent signal of the dicyanine was enhanced by up to 27-fold after interacting with the GSH solution. <i>In vivo</i> xenografts tumor studies further revealed that the fluorescence signals of aforementioned dyes can be quickly recovered in the solid tumor. <b>Conclusion</b>: In summary, the disulfide dicyanines dyes can provide a promising platform for specific tumor-activatable fluorescence imaging with improved T/B value.",,,"Animals, Coloring Agents, Diagnostic Imaging, Disulfides, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Glutathione, Humans, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Molecular Probe Techniques, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Tumor Microenvironment",,

For the achiral meso form, a new synthetic route towards asymmetric cyanine dyes was established. All compounds form J aggregates in water, the optical properties of which were characterised by means of spectroscopic methods. The supramolecular structure of the aggregates is investigated by means of cryo-transmission electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography and AFM, revealing extended sheet-like aggregates for chiral enantiomers and nanotubes for the mesomer, respectively, whereas the conformer forms predominately needle-like crystals. The experiments demonstrate that the aggregation behaviour of compounds can be controlled solely by head group stereochemistry, which in the case of enantiomers enables the formation of extended hydrogen-bond chains by the hydroxyl functionalities. In case of the achiral meso form, however, such chains turned out to be sterically excluded.",,,,,
32022444,Integration of Indocyanine Green Analogs as Near-Infrared Fluorescent Carrier for Precise Imaging-Guided Gene Delivery.,"Codelivery of diagnostic probes and therapeutic molecules often suffers from intrinsic complexity and premature leakage from or degradation of the nanocarrier. Inspired by the ""Y"" shape of indocyanine green (ICG), the dye is integrated in an amphiphilic lipopeptide (RNF). The hydrophilic segment is composed of arginine-rich dendritic peptides, while cyanine dyes are modified with two long carbon chains and employed as the hydrophobic moiety. They are linked through a disulfide linkage to improve the responsivity in the tumor microenvironment. After formulation with other lipopeptides at an optimized ratio, the theranostic system (RNS-2) forms lipid-based nanoparticles with slight positive zeta potential enabling efficient condensation of DNA. The RNS-2 displays glutathione responded gene release, activatable fluorescence recovery, and up to sevenfold higher in vitro transfection than Lipofectamine 2000. Compared with a Cy3 and Cy5 labeled fluorescence resonance energy transfer indicator for gene release, the ""turn-on"" indocyanine green analogs exhibit longer emission wavelength and better positive correlation with the dynamic processes of gene delivery. More importantly, the RNS-2 system enables efficient near infrared imaging guided gene transfer in tumor-bearing mice and thus provides more precise and accurate information on location of the cargo gene and synthesized carriers.",,,"Animals, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Transfer Techniques, Indocyanine Green, Mice, Nanoparticles, Optical Imaging",,

Through application of a new labeling strategy for peptides, a series of fluorescent neurotensin(8-13) derivatives was synthesized by attaching red-emitting fluorophores (indolinium- and pyridinium-type cyanine dyes) to carbamoylated arginine residues in neurotensin(8-13) analogues, yielding fluorescent probes with high NTS<sub>1</sub>R affinity (p<i>K</i> <sub>i</sub> values: 8.15-9.12) and potency (pEC<sub>50</sub> values (Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization): 8.23-9.43). Selected fluorescent ligands were investigated by flow cytometry and high-content imaging (saturation binding, kinetic studies, and competition binding) as well as by confocal microscopy using intact CHO-hNTS<sub>1</sub>R cells. The study demonstrates the applicability of the fluorescent probes as molecular tools to obtain, for example, information about the localization of receptors in cells and to determine binding affinities of nonlabeled ligands.",,,,,
31909595,Role of Albumin in Accumulation and Persistence of Tumor-Seeking Cyanine Dyes.,"Some heptamethine cyanine dyes accumulate in solid tumors <i>in vivo</i> and persist there for several days. The reasons why they accumulate and persist in tumors were incompletely defined, but explanations based on uptake into cancer cells via organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) have been widely discussed. All cyanine-based ""tumor-seeking dyes"" have a chloride centrally placed on the heptamethine bridge (a ""<i>meso</i>-chloride""). We were intrigued and perplexed by the correlation between this particular functional group and tumor uptake, so the following study was designed. It features four dyes (<b>1</b>-Cl, <b>1</b>-Ph, <b>5</b>-Cl, and <b>5</b>-Ph) with complementary properties. Dye <b>1</b>-Cl is otherwise known as MHI-148, and <b>1</b>-Ph is a close analog wherein the <i>meso</i>-chloride has been replaced by a phenyl group. Data presented here shows that both <b>1</b>-Cl and <b>1</b>-Ph form noncovalent adducts with albumin, but only <b>1</b>-Cl can form a covalent one. Both dyes <b>5</b>-Cl and <b>5</b>-Ph have a methylene (CH<sub>2</sub>) unit replaced by a dimethylammonium functionality (N<sup>+</sup>Me<sub>2</sub>). Data presented here shows that both these dyes <b>5</b> do not form tight noncovalent adducts with albumin, and only <b>5</b>-Cl can form a covalent one (though much more slowly than <b>1</b>-Cl). In tissue culture experiments, uptake of dyes <b>1</b> is more impacted by the albumin in the media than by the pan-OATP uptake inhibitor (BSP) that has been used to connect uptake of tumor-seeking dyes <i>in vivo</i> with the OATPs. Uptake of <b>1</b>-Cl in media containing fluorescein-labeled albumin gave a high degree of colocalization of intracellular fluorescence. No evidence was found for the involvement of OATPs in uptake of the dyes into cells in media containing albumin. In an <i>in vivo</i> tumor model, only the two dyes that can form albumin adducts (<b>1</b>-Cl and <b>5</b>-Cl) gave intratumor fluorescence that persisted long enough to be clearly discerned over the background (∼4 h); this fluorescence was still observed at 48 h. Tumors could be imaged with a higher contrast if <b>5</b>-Cl is used instead of <b>1</b>-Cl, because <b>5</b>-Cl is cleared more rapidly from healthy tissues. Overall, the evidence is consistent with <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> results and indicates that the two dyes in the test series that accumulate in tumors and persist there (<b>1</b>-Cl and <b>5</b>-Cl, true tumor-seeking dyes) do so as covalent albumin adducts trapped in tumor tissue via uptake by some cancer cells and via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.",,,"Albumins, Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Fluorescent Dyes, Hep G2 Cells, Humans, Indoles, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Organic Anion Transporters",,
31897456,Fabrication of a water-soluble near-infrared fluorescent probe for selective detection and imaging of dipeptidyl peptidase IV in biological systems.,"Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) is a transmembrane glycoprotein known to regulate T cell activation, which is related to various pathological processes and has become a potential target to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therefore, it is significant for the evaluation of endogenous DPP-IV activity in various biological systems. Herein, a water-soluble near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probe HCA-D based on cyanine dyes as the fluorophore and glycyl-prolyl peptide as the specific recognition sequence was developed for the assay of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity. Upon addition of DPP-IV, HCA-D can emit a significant turn-on NIR fluorescence signal under physiological conditions and exhibit high selectivity toward DPP-IV. This feature was available for quantifying DPP-IV in the range from 0.62 to 10 ng mL<sup>-1</sup> with a detection limit of 0.19 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the present probe was successfully employed for monitoring DPP-IV in serum samples from diabetic and healthy people, and imaging of DPP-IV in living cells and tumor mice models. These results demonstrate that the designed probe provides a promising tool to explore the relationship between DPP-IV and diabetes mellitus or other diseases. Perhaps, it may become a prospective image-guided tumor resection indicator based on the abnormal expression of DPP-IV activity in the future.",,,"Animals, Cell Survival, Cells, Cultured, Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4, Dipeptidyl-Peptidase IV Inhibitors, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Infrared Rays, Liver Neoplasms, Experimental, Materials Testing, Mice, Mice, Inbred Strains, Molecular Structure, Optical Imaging, RAW 264.7 Cells, Sitagliptin Phosphate, Solubility, Water",,
33718004,Effects of physical orientation of dye molecules and molecular orbitals on performance of solid-state dye sensitized solar cells.,"Performance of Dye-sensitized devices depends on the photon absorption and carrier injection properties of the sensitizer (dye). The orientation of the dye molecule affects the photon absorption cross-section, injection efficiency and carrier transport. These effects are studied, using three variants of cyanine dyes in <i>n</i>-TiO<sub>2</sub>/Dye/<i>p</i>-CuSCN heterojunction. The results show correlation of dye-molecule's orientation on the short-circuit-photocurrent (I<sub>sc</sub>). The open-circuit-voltage (V<sub>oc</sub>) is also subjective.

31821398,About the origin of the large Stokes shift in aminoalkyl substituted heptamethine cyanine dyes.,"Aminoalkyl-substituted heptamethine cyanine dyes are characterized by a large Stokes shift, an uncommon feature for cyanine molecules yet very promising for their application as fluorescent probes in bioimaging and as light harvesting antennas in biohybrid systems for solar energy conversion. The origin of this photophysical feature has not been adequately explored so far, and a combined experimental and theoretical work is herein provided to shed light on the role played by the central aminoalkyl substituent bound to the heptamethine cyanine backbone in defining the unusual properties of the dye. The spectra recorded in solvents of different polarities point to a marginal role of the medium in the definition of the Stokes shift, which conversely can be ascribed to the relaxation of the molecular geometry upon photoexcitation. This hypothesis is supported by an extensive theoretical investigation of the ground and excited states of the dye. TD-DFT results on the aminoalkyl-substituted dye and its unsubstituted precursor demonstrate a very similar cyanine-like structure for both molecules in the relaxed excited state. Conversely, in the ground state the amino substitution disrupts the conjugation in the polymethine chain, leading to a broken-symmetry, non-planar structure.",,,,,
31819780,Dye Encapsulation in Fluorescent Core-Shell Silica Nanoparticles as Probed by Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy.,"Synthetic advances in the formation of ultrasmall (<10 nm) fluorescent poly(ethylene glycol)-coated (PEGylated) core-shell silica nanoparticles (SNPs), enabling improved particle size and surface chemical property control have led to successful clinical translation of SNPs as diagnostic probes in oncology. Despite the success of such probes, details of the dye incorporation and resulting silica architecture are still poorly understood. Here, we employ afterpulse-corrected fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) to monitor fast fluorescence fluctuations (lag times <10<sup>-5</sup> s) of the negatively charged cyanine dye Cy5 as a probe to study such details for dye encapsulation in 5 nm silica cores of PEGylated core-shell SNPs (C dots). Upon deposition of additional silica shells over the silica core we find that the amplitude of photo-induced cis-trans isomerization decreases, suggesting that the Cy5 dyes are located near or on the surface of the original SNP cores. In combination with time correlated fluorescence decay measurements we deduce radiative and non-radiative rates of the Cy5 dye in these particles. Results demonstrate that FCS is a well-suited tool to investigate aspects of the photophysics of fluorescent nanoparticles, and that conformational changes of cyanine dyes like Cy5 are excellent indicators for the local dye environment within ultrasmall SNPs.",,,,,

Currently, only a few classes of far-red/NIR fluorophores are available including widely used cyanine dyes, which are susceptible to photobleaching and form nonfluorescent aggregates. Even rare are those far-red/NIR emitting dyes that have two-photon imaging capability. Here we report a new class of far-red/NIR-emitting dyes that are photo-stable, very bright, biocompatible, and also two-photon absorbing. The introduction of an electron-withdrawing group such as <i>N</i>-acyl or <i>N</i>-alkoxycarbonyl groups on the C-10-amino substituent of the new julolidine-derived amino-Si-pyronin dyes (ASiP<sup>j</sup>), which emit in the far-red region, causes large bathochromic shifts, leading to NIR-emitting amino-Si-pyronin dyes (NIR-ASiP<sup>j</sup>) having high cellular stability. Furthermore, the ASiP<sup>j</sup>-NIR-ASiP<sup>j</sup> couple offers a novel ratiometric bioimaging platform with a large spectral gap, as demonstrated here with a boronate-containing NIR-ASiP<sup>j</sup> derivative that is converted to the corresponding ASiP<sup>j</sup> dye upon reaction with hydrogen peroxide.",,,,,

Here, we engineered a supramolecular assembly of protein complex with lodged cyanine dyes to produce a brilliant NIR-II fluorophore, providing a NIR-II quantum yield of 21.2% with prolonged circulation time. Computational modeling revealed the mechanism for fluorescence enhancement and identified key parameters governing albumin complex for NIR-II fluorophores. Our complex afforded high-resolution microvessel imaging, with a 3-hour imaging window compared to 2 min for free dye alone. Furthermore, the complexation strategy was applied to an antibody-derived assembly, offering high-contrast tumor imaging without affecting the targeting ability of the antibody.

In particular, the cyanine dyes that bind selectively to G-quadruplex structures without targeting duplex DNA have attracted attention due to their high amenability to structural modifications that allows fine-tuning of their biomolecular interactions. We have previously reported pentamethine and symmetric trimethine cyanines designed to effectively bind G-quadruplexes through end stacking interactions. Herein, we are reporting a second generation of drug candidates, the asymmetric trimethine cyanines. These have been synthesized and evaluated for their quadruplex binding properties. Incorporating a benz[<i>c</i>,<i>d</i>]indolenine heterocyclic unit increased overall quadruplex binding, and elongating the alkyl length increases the quadruplex-to-duplex binding specificity.",,,"Alkynes, Base Sequence, DNA, Drug Design, G-Quadruplexes, Indoles, Models, Molecular",,
31515919,Photo-isomerization of the Cyanine Dye Alexa-Fluor 647 (AF-647) in the Context of dSTORM Super-Resolution Microscopy.,"Cyanine dyes, as used in super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, undergo light-induced ""blinking"", enabling localization of fluorophores with spatial resolution beyond the optical diffraction limit. Despite a plethora of studies, the molecular origins of this blinking are not well understood. Here, we examine the photophysical properties of a bio-conjugate cyanine dye (AF-647), used extensively in dSTORM imaging. In the absence of a potent sacrificial reductant, light-induced electron transfer and intermediates formed via the metastable, triplet excited state are considered unlikely to play a significant role in the blinking events. Instead, it is found that, under conditions appropriate to dSTORM microscopy, AF-647 undergoes reversible photo-induced isomerization to at least two long-lived dark species. These photo-isomers are characterized spectroscopically and their interconversion probed by computational means. The first-formed isomer is light sensitive and transforms to a longer-lived species in modest yield that could be involved in dSTORM related blinking. Permanent photobleaching of AF-647 occurs with very low quantum yield and is partially suppressed by the anaerobic redox buffer.",,,,,
31485813,Spectral-Fluorescent Study of the Interaction of Cationic and Anionic Polymethine Dyes with Sodium Deoxycholate in Aqueous Solutions.,"The noncovalent interaction of a number of cationic and anionic meso-substituted polymethine (carbocyanine) dyes with sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) as a biologically important surfactant was studied by spectral-fluorescent methods. The following dyes were studied: 3,3'-di(β-hydroxyethyl)-9-methylthiacarbocyanine-iodide (K1), 3,3'-di(β-hydroxyethyl)-5,5'-dimethoxy-9-ethylthiacarbocyanine iodide (K2), 3,3',9-trimethylthiacarbocyanine iodide (K3, Cyan 2), 3,3'-di(γ-sulfopropyl)-9-methylthiacarbocyanine-betaine (A1), and 3,3'-di(γ-sulfopropyl)-4,5,4',5'-dibenzo-9-ethylthiacarbocyanine-betaine (A2, DEC). Upon addition of increasing concentrations of NaDC, the absorption spectra of dyes K1-K3 in aqueous solutions exhibit changes due to the formation of dye aggregates and their subsequent decomposition into monomers. The formation of aggregates of K1-K3 leads to broadening of the absorption spectra and an appearance of additional bands. Upon binding to the surfactant, the cis-monomers of the dyes undergo partial cis-trans conversion, which is accompanied by an increase in the fluorescence intensity. The binding constants of the dyes to NaDC were estimated on the basis of Scatchard and Hill models from the dependences of the absorption and fluorescence spectra on the concentration of NaDC.",,,,,
31460363,Click Chemistry in the Design and Production of Hybrid Tracers.,"Hybrid tracers containing both fluorescent and radioactive imaging labels have demonstrated clinical potential during sentinel lymph node procedures.

For α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub>-integrin-targeting hybrid tracers, providing an excellent model for evaluating tracer development strategies, end-labeling-based synthesis provides a rather cumbersome synthesis strategy.

31432408,Application of 2D-DIGE and iTRAQ Workflows to Analyze CSF in Gliomas.,"Proteomics is an indispensable tool for disease biomarker discovery. It is widely used for the analysis of biological fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood, and saliva, which further aids in our understanding of disease incidence and progression.

On the contrary studies comprising of serum or plasma samples do not truly reflect the underlying molecular alterations due to the presence of protective blood-brain barrier. We have described in here the detailed workflows for two advanced proteomics techniques, namely, 2D-DIGE (two-dimensional difference in-gel electrophoresis) and iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation), for CSF analysis. Both of these techniques are very sensitive and widely used for quantitative proteomics analysis.",,,"Brain Neoplasms, Cerebrospinal Fluid Proteins, Chemical Fractionation, Glioma, Humans, Mass Spectrometry, Proteome, Proteomics, Software, Staining and Labeling, Tumor Microenvironment, Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis, Workflow",,
31402654,Improvement of Photostability and NIR Activity of Cyanine Dye through Nanohybrid Formation: Key Information from Ultrafast Dynamical Studies.,"Near-infrared (NIR) light harvesting has enormous importance for different potential applications in the modern era of research. Some NIR cyanine dyes such as IR820 have achieved great success in energy harvesting and cancer therapy. However, their action is limited for low photostability, considerable thermal degradation, short circulation times, and nonspecific biodistribution. Our present study is an attempt to overcome such limitations by attaching a model cyanine dye IR820 with ZnO nanoparticles. We prepared an IR820-ZnO nanohybrid and characterized it using microscopic and optical spectroscopic tools. Thermogravimetric analysis depicted greater thermal stability of the IR820-ZnO nanohybrid compared to free dye. We explored the enhancement in the photostability of IR820 upon nanohybrid formation. We detected generation of photoinduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide, singlet oxygen, and so forth using appropriate molecular probes. The formation of IR820-ZnO nanohybrid reduced production of photoinduced singlet oxygen. However, it revealed an alternative trend in overall ROS formation (increases total ROS) under red light illumination. To correlate the enhanced photostability of IR820 on the ZnO surface, we explored excited-state dynamical processes at the interface in nanohybrids. We illustrated the photoinduced excited-state electron-transfer process from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of IR820 to the conduction band of ZnO. This photoelectron-transfer process enhances the production of ROS and decreases the formation of singlet oxygen that altogether leads to improvement in photostability and overall activity. A quencher of singlet oxygen sodium azide (NaN<sub>3</sub>) was used to further confirm the direct association of singlet oxygen generation with the photostability issue of IR820. Also, ZnO is able to deliver the dye selectively in acidic environment, which suggests its diseased site-specific targeted activity. Our results provide promising improvement for potential use of IR820 through formation of a nanohybrid that could be translated for other NIR cyanine dyes.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Infrared Rays, Molecular Structure, Nanoparticles, Particle Size, Photochemical Processes, Reactive Oxygen Species, Surface Properties, Thermodynamics, Zinc Oxide",,
35528639,Synergetic effects of Cu/TiO<sub>2</sub> sensitized with different cyanine dyes on hydrogen evolution.,"The production of hydrogen as an alternative fuel is a major challenge for developed countries. To achieve this, photocatalysis is a promising method, which depends mainly on a renewable energy source, namely, the sun. Many derivatives of cyanine-sensitized Cu/TiO<sub>2</sub> were prepared and characterized by XRD, SEM-EDS, TEM, BET surface area and UV-vis spectrophotometry and their photocatalytic activity was studied. The study of hydrogen production over the sensitized photocatalysts confirmed the significant role of the dyes in the enhancement of hydrogen production. Dye molecules harness light radiation to produce strong oxidizing species, such as hydroxyl radicals, which in turn form hydrogen molecules. Combining sonolysis with photocatalysis processes proved that ultrasound waves inhibit the agglomeration of particles and maintain their surface area. This synergetic process increased the efficiency of hydrogen production by 7 times using photocatalysis only.",,,,,
31378572,The synthesis of a novel Crizotinib heptamethine cyanine dye conjugate that potentiates the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of Crizotinib in patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines.,"We describe the synthesis of drug-dye conjugate 1 between anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitor Crizotinib and heptamethine cyanine dye IR-786. The drug-dye conjugate 1 was evaluated in three different patient-derived glioblastoma cell lines and showed potent cytotoxic activity with nanomolar potency (EC<sub>50</sub>: 50.9 nM). We also demonstrate evidence for antiproliferative activity of 1 with single digit nanomolar potency (IC<sub>50</sub>: 4.7 nM). Furthermore, the cytotoxic effects conveyed a dramatic, 110-fold improvement over Crizotinib. This improvement was even more pronounced (492-fold) when 1 was combined with Temozolomide, the standard drug for treatment for glioblastoma.

31326855,Cyanine dyes with tail length asymmetry enhance photoselection: A multiscale study on DiD probes in a liquid disordered membrane.,"Visualization of membrane domains like lipid rafts in natural or artificial membranes is a crucial task for cell biology. For this purpose, fluorescence microscopy is often used. Since fluorescing probes in lipid membranes partition specifically in e.g. local liquid disordered or liquid ordered environments, the consequent changes in their orientation and location are both theoretically and experimentally of interest. Here we focused on a liquid disordered membrane phase and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the indocarbocyanine DiD probes by varying the length of the attached alkyl tails and also the length of the cyanine backbone. From the probed compounds in a DOPC lipid bilayer at ambient temperature, a varying orientation of the transition dipole moment was observed, which is crucial for fluorescence microscopy and which, through photoselection, was found to be surprisingly more effective for asymmetric probes than for the symmetric ones. Furthermore, we observed that the orientation of the probes was dependent on the tail length; with the methyls or propyls attached, DiD oriented with its tails facing the water, contrary to the ones with longer tails. With advanced hybrid QM/MM calculations we show that the different local environment for differently oriented probes affected the one-photon absorption spectra, that was blue-shifted for the short-tailed DiD with respect to the DiDs with longer tails. We show here that the presented probes can be successfully used for fluorescence microscopy and we believe that the described properties bring further insight for the experimental use of these probes.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Lipid Bilayers, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

31246000,Iodinated Cyanine Dyes for Fast Near-Infrared-Guided Deep Tissue Synergistic Phototherapy.,"Phototheranostics, which combines deep tissue imaging and phototherapy [photodynamic therapy (PDT) and/or photothermal therapy (PTT)] via light irradiation, is a promising strategy to treat tumors. Near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dyes are researched as potential phototheranostics reagents for their excellent photophysical properties. However, the low singlet oxygen generation efficiency of cyanine dyes often leads to inadequate therapeutic efficacy for tumors. Herein, we modified an indocyanine green derivative Cy7 with heavy atom iodine to form a novel NIR dye CyI to improve the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and heat generation while, at the same time, maintain their fluorescence characteristics for in vivo noninvasive imaging. More importantly, in vitro and in vivo therapeutic results illustrated that CyI could quickly and simultaneously generate enhanced ROS and heat to induce more cancer cell apoptosis and higher inhibition rates in deep HepG2 tumors than other noniodinated NIR dyes upon NIR irradiation. Besides, low toxicity of the resulted iodinated NIR dyes was confirmed by in vivo biodistribution and acute toxicity. Results indicate that this low toxic NIR dye could be an ideal phototheranostics agent for deep tumor treatments.

31244928,QuatCy: A Heptamethine Cyanine Modification With Improved Characteristics.,"A major restriction on optical imaging techniques is the range of available fluorophores that are compatible with aqueous media without aggregation, absorb light above 750 nm with high extinction coefficients, fluoresce with relatively high quantum yields, and resist photodecomposition. Indocyanine green (ICG or <b>A</b> in this paper) is an important example of a fluorophore that fits this description. Other dyes that are becoming increasingly prevalent are select heptamethine cyanine dyes (Cy7) which feature a cyclohexyl framework to rigidify the conjugated alkenes, and <i>meso</i>-chlorine substitution; MHI-148 (<b>B</b>) is one example. <b>Methods</b>: Research described here was initiated to uncover the consequences of a simple isoelectronic substitution to MHI-148 that replaces a cyclohexyl methylene with a dialkyl ammonium fragment. Solubility experiments were carried out in aqueous and cell culture media, photophysical properties including fluorescence quantum yields, brightness and stability were measured. Moreover, <i>in vivo</i> pharmacokinetics, distribution and tumor seeking properties were also explored. <b>Results</b>: Modification to incorporate dialkyl ammonium fragment leads to a brighter, more photostable fluorophore, with a decreased tendency to aggregation, complementary solubility characteristics, and a lower cytotoxicity. <b>Conclusion</b>: All the above-mentioned parameters are favorable for many anticipated applications of the new dye we now call <i>quaternary cyanine-7</i> or <i>QuatCy</i>.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Survival, Culture Media, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Molecular Structure, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Solubility",,
31184485,Circularly Polarized Luminescence of Achiral Cyanine Molecules Assembled on DNA Templates.,"The exploration of biocompatible materials with circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) activity is becoming an attractive topic due to the great potential application in biosensing and bioimaging. Here, we describe a strategy to fabricate new CPL-active biomaterials using achiral carbazole-based biscyanine fluorophores coassembled with chiral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules. This cyanine molecule has been shown to behave as a DNA detecting probe, featuring strong fluorescent emission induced by restriction of intramolecular rotation (RIR). When the achiral cyanine molecules are bound to the minor groove of DNA via electrostatic attraction in aqueous solution, the chirality of the DNA molecules can be transferred to the confined RIR cyanine dyes, triggering a remarkable circularly polarized luminescent emission. The chirality of the CPL signal can be regulated by the structures of the DNA templates. Stimuli-responsive CPL activates were observed from DNA-cyanine complexes. We further verified this strategy on different DNA-based nanomaterials, including DNA origami nanostructure. Our design presents a new avenue to fabricate compatible CPL materials.",,,"Carbazoles, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Nanocomposites, Pyridinium Compounds, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
31139724,Uptake and Fate of Fluorescently Labeled DNA Nanostructures in Cellular Environments: A Cautionary Tale.,"Fluorescent dye labeling of DNA oligonucleotides and nanostructures is one of the most used techniques to track their fate and cellular localization inside cells. Here, we report that intracellular fluorescence, and even FRET signals, cannot be correlated with the cellular uptake of intact DNA structures. Live cell imaging revealed high colocalization of cyanine-labeled DNA oligos and nanostructures with phosphorylated small-molecule cyanine dyes, one of the degradation products from these DNA compounds. Nuclease degradation of the strands outside and inside the cell results in a misleading intracellular fluorescent signal. The signal is saturated by the fluorescence of the degradation product (phosphorylated dye). To test our hypothesis, we synthesized a range of DNA structures, including Cy3- and Cy5-labeled DNA cubes and DNA tetrahedra, and oligonucleotides with different stabilities toward nucleases. All give fluorescence signals within the mitochondria after cellular uptake and strongly colocalize with a free phosphorylated dye control. Kinetics experiments revealed that uptake of stable DNA structures is delayed. We also studied several parameters influencing fluorescent data: stability of the DNA strand, fixation methods that can wash away the signal, position of the dye on the DNA strand, and design of FRET experiments. DNA nanostructures hold tremendous potential for biomedical applications and biotechnology because of their biocompatibility, programmability, and easy synthesis. However, few examples of successful DNA machines <i>in vivo</i> have been reported. We believe this contribution can be used as a guide to design better cellular uptake experiments when using fluorescent dyes, in order to further propel the biological development, and application of DNA nanostructures.",,,,,
31137776,Disassembly of Dimeric Cyanine Dye Supramolecular Assembly by Tetramolecular G-quadruplex Dependence on Linker Length and Layers of G-quartet.,"Cyanine dyes have been widely applied in various biological systems owing to their specific photochemical properties. Assembly and disassembly process of cyanine dyes were constructed and regulated by special biomolecules. In this paper, dimeric cyanine dyes with different repeat units (oligo-oxyethylene) in linker (TC-Pn) (<i>n</i> = 3-6) were found to form H-aggregates or mixture aggregates in PBS. These aggregates could be disassembled into dimer and/or monomer by (TGnT) tetramolecular G-quadruplexes (<i>n</i> = 3-6, 8), which were affected by the linker length of dimeric cyanine dyes and layers of G-quartets. The <sup>1</sup>H-NMR titration results suggest that the binding mode of dimeric cyanine dye with TGnT might be on both ends-stacking like a clip. This binding mode could clearly explain that matching structures between dimeric cyanine dyes and TGnT quadruplexes could regulate the disassembly properties of aggregates.

Current pharmacological interventions for these two diseases therefore aim to restore normal dopamine levels in the midbrain. But during therapy, there is a overshooting of dopamine concentrations that result in hallucinations in Parkinson's disease patients and extra-pyramidal symptoms in schizophrenic patients. This causes a lot of inconvenience to the patents and the clinicians. There are no tests currently available to monitor drug efficacy in these two neuropsychiatric diseases. Parkinson's disease and schizophrenic naïve patients were recruited. Serum proteins isolated from these two clinical phenotypes were labeled with fluorescent cyanine dyes and analyzed by two-dimensional difference in gel electrophoresis proteomic experiment. Differentially expressed spots that had consistent expression pattern across five sets of biological replicate gels were trypsin digested and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis for protein identification. Validation experiments were done for the identified proteins using antibody-based assay on a patient cohort that included naïve, treated, and those who had side effects. Serum α- and β-globin chains were identified as differentially expressed proteins having threefold higher expressions in Parkinson's patients as compared to schizophrenia. Interestingly, concentrations of these two proteins had an inverse correlation across clinical phenotypes in the dopaminergic spectrum. RBC contamination as a source for these proteins was ruled out. There is a clear association of free serum globin with dopaminergic clinical states. This lays a platform for protein biomarker-based monitoring of pharmacological efficacy in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia.",,,,,

This review focuses on summarizing organic dyes emitting at a biological transparency window termed the near-infrared-II (NIR-II) window, where minimal light interaction with the surrounding tissues allows photons to travel nearly unperturbed throughout the body. NIR-II fluorescence imaging overcomes the penetration/contrast bottleneck of imaging in the visible region, making it a remarkable modality for early diagnosis of cancer and highly sensitive tumor surgery. Due to their convenient bioconjugation with peptides/antibodies, NIR-II molecular dyes are desirable candidates for targeted cancer imaging, significantly overcoming the autofluorescence/scattering issues for deep tissue molecular imaging. To promote the clinical translation of NIR-II bioimaging, advancements in the high-performance small molecule-derived probes are critically important. Here, molecules with clinical potential for NIR-II imaging are discussed, summarizing the synthesis and chemical structures of NIR-II dyes, chemical and optical properties of NIR-II dyes, bioconjugation and biological behavior of NIR-II dyes, whole body imaging with NIR-II dyes for cancer detection and surgery, as well as NIR-II fluorescence microscopy imaging.

Fluorescence parameters of the known and new dyes in complexes with various DNA structures, including G-quadruplexes (G4s) and i-motifs (IMs), were analyzed. All dyes efficiently distinguished G4s and ss-DNA. The bi- and tri-substituted derivatives had basically similar distributions of relative fluorescence intensities. The mono-substituted derivatives exhibited enhanced sensitivity to parallel G4s. All dyes were particularly sensitive to a G4 structure with an additional duplex module (the thrombin-binding aptamer TBA31), presumably due to a distinctive binding mode (interaction with the junction between the two modules). In particular, BO showed a strong (160-fold) enhancement in fluorescence quantum yield in complex with TBA31 compared to the free dye. The fluorescence quantum yields of the 2,4-bisubstituted derivative in complex with well-characterized G4s from oncogene promoters were in the range of 0.04-0.28, i.e. comparable to those of ThT.

However, there are few studies of exciton dynamics in DNA-templated dye aggregates. We report time-resolved excited-state dynamics measurements of two cyanine-based dye aggregates, a J-like dimer and an H-like tetramer, formed through DNA-templating of covalently attached dyes. Time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption indicate that nonradiative decay, in the form of internal conversion, dominates the aggregate ground state recovery dynamics, with singlet exciton lifetimes on the order of tens of picoseconds for the aggregates versus nanoseconds for the monomer.

For reliable and quantitative analysis, the staining efficiency of the dyes should not be very dependent on the sequences of the specimens. However, this assumption has not necessarily been confirmed by experimental results, especially in the staining of ssDNA (and RNA). In this study, we found that both SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold did not stain either homopyrimidines or ssDNA composed of only adenine (A) and cytosine (C). However, these two dyes emit strong fluorescence when the ssDNA contains both guanine (G) and C (and/or both A and thymine (T)) and form potential Watson-Crick base pairs. Interestingly, SYBR Gold, but not SYBR Green II, strongly stains ssDNA consisting of G and A (or G and T).

A strong cathodic ECL emission was obtained by the CdTe QDs modified glassy carbon electrode (GCE). After the immobilization with the capture DNA (cDNA) and the sequential hybridization with the probe DNA-modified Cy5 (pDNA, the aptamer of OTA), the ECL signal enhanced obviously through the ECL-RET. Meanwhile, the spectrum- and distance-related ECL enhancement effect was investigated. When the target OTA was in the presence, the pDNA-Cy5 molecules were released from the electrode surface owing to the specific interaction between OTA and aptamer, resulting in an evident decrease of ECL signal.

30633242,[Multiplex Assay to Evaluate the Genetic Risk of Developing Human Melanoma].,"A genotyping procedure based on single-step PCR and subsequent allele-specific hybridization on a hydrogel biochip was developed to address the polymorphisms of HERC2, OCA2, SLC24A4, SLC45A2, TYR, IRF4, MC1R,MITF, PIGU, MYH7B, NCOA6, and CDK10. Amplified gene fragments were fluorescently labeled in PCR, and fluorescent signals from biochip cells were detected to evaluate how efficiently the PCR product formed a perfect duplex with an immobilized probe. The analytical characteristics of hybridization analysis were estimated for several fluorophores with different optical spectra. Cyanine dyes fluorescing in the range of Cy5 and Cy7 were synthesized for the purpose and used as 5'-tags of universal primers in single-step PCR. A Cy7 analog fluorescing in the near infrared range was found to increase the sensitivity of hybridization analysis by producing a lower background signal in the cases where target gene amplification was low.",,,"Alleles, DNA Primers, Genotyping Techniques, Humans, Melanoma, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Polymorphism, Genetic, Risk Factors",,
30614679,DNA G-Quadruplexes as a Template To Direct Cyanine Dyes To Form H-Aggregates and Application of the Self-Assembly Entity as a New G-Quadruplexes Ligands Screening Platform.,"The organization of organic chromophores to form H-/J-aggregates can result in new biomaterials with unique properties and applications. DNA-template self-assembly is one of the most attractive strategies to guide the formation of chromophore aggregates. However, the DNA templates are mainly limited to canonical nucleic acids structures [single (ss)- and double (ds)-stranded DNA]. DNA G-quadruplexes (GQs), with distinct and various structural features, were rarely exploited to guide the formation of dye aggregates. In this study, we present the spontaneous assembly of cyanine dye IR786 to form H-aggregates on DNA GQs exclusively, but no IR786 aggregates formed by adjusting the experimental parameters or on ss-/ds-DNA. Furthermore, on the basis of the assembly entity (GQs-IR786), an adaptive GQs-FID (fluorescence intercalator displacement) assay for screening of GQs ligands was developed. In contrast with the existing GQs-FID screening schemes, this assay displayed attractive performance in many aspects (such as turn-on signal output, broad screening range, and time saving). All these results have undoubtedly demonstrated the great values of DNA GQs as a template to guide the formation of dye aggregates. We hope that more GQs structures would be exploited as templates to expand the variety of functional materials in the future. Moreover, the specifically formed H-aggregates of IR786 on GQs are significant for GQs' detection, and we also expect that this GQs-FID assay would be further studied and finally applied to screen GQs ligands in a high-throughput manner in the future.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, G-Quadruplexes, Ligands, Models, Molecular",,
30540461,Indolizine-Cyanine Dyes: Near Infrared Emissive Cyanine Dyes with Increased Stokes Shifts.,"Molecular engineering strategies designed to red-shift cyanine dye absorptions and emissions further into the near-infrared (NIR) spectral region are explored. Through the use of a novel donor group, indolizine, with varying cyanine bridge lengths, dye absorptions and emissions, were shifted deeper into the NIR region than common indoline-cyanines. Stokes shifts resulting from intramolecular steric interactions of up to ∼60 nm in many cases were observed and explained computationally. Molecular brightnesses of up to 5800 deep into the NIR region were observed. Structure-property relationships are explored for the six indolizine-cyanine dyes with varying cyanine bridge length and indolizine substituents showing broad absorption and emission tunability. The dyes are characterized by crystallography, and the photophysical properties are probed by varying solvent for absorption and emission studies. Computational data show involvement of the entire indolizine π-system during light absorption, which suggests these systems can be tunable even further into the NIR region through select derivatizations.",,,,,
33418819,Glutathione Triggered Near Infrared Fluorescence Imaging-Guided Chemotherapy by Cyanine Conjugated Polypeptide.,"Precise detection of the tumor environment for cancer diagnosis has been strongly demanded for further therapies. Here, a redox-responsive fluorescence switch off/on system PCQ was designed and synthesized conjugated with near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dyes (Cy5.5) and relevant quencher (FQ) in mixed polymeric micelles (PCy and PFQ). The mixed PCQ micelles were prepared with two kinds of polymers with poly(oligo (ethylene glycol) methacrylate) (POEGMA) as the hydrophilic shell, in which fluorescence emission was quenched by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) effect. The FQ was conjugated with POEGMA by disulfide linkage, which could be broken with a redox environment such as high glutathione (GSH) concentration in tumor cells. After the PCQ micelles got into tumor cells, PFQ blocks in PCQ would be disassembled to recompose PCy micelles. During that process, drugs like doxorubicin (DOX) could be loaded inside and formed PCQ@DOX nanoparticles and then released for accurate NIR bioimaging and drug delivery instantly.",,,,,
32254743,NIR organic dyes based on phenazine-cyanine for photoacoustic imaging-guided photothermal therapy.,"As non-invasive diagnosis and therapy methods, photoacoustic (PA) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) have attracted extensive attention. Herein, two new acceptor-donor-acceptor near-infrared organic phenazine-cyanine dyes PH-1 and PH-2 were reported for photoacoustic imaging-guided photodynamic therapy. In the strong donor phenazine molecule, the electron-withdrawing indole salt unit was introduced for absorption to the near-infrared region. To improve water solubility, the two organic dyes were assembled with human serum albumin (HSA) to form nanoparticles of appropriate sizes, i.e., PH-1@HSA and PH-2@HSA, which showed excellent stability in both weakly acidic and weakly basic environments. Moreover, the results showed that PH-1@HSA and PH-2@HSA nanoparticles can effectively transform luminous energy to thermal energy in vitro and in vivo, and they can be utilized for PA imaging. Importantly, PH-1@HSA can accumulate in mice subcutaneous tumors by enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) and damage cancer tissues effectively.",,,,,
30485632,Superweak Coordinating Anion as Superstrong Enhancer of Cyanine Organic Semiconductor Properties.,"The superweak tetrakis(nonafluoro-tert-butoxy)aluminate coordinating anion was employed to introduce pseudo-gas-phase conditions to the 2-[5-(1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1,3-pentadien-1-yl]-1,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium chromophore. The resulting formation of a photoactive organic-inorganic hybrid salt has led to a highly stabilized excited state of the organic chromophore mainly due to the minimized lattice energy and Coulomb interactions. These highly beneficial features caused by the well dispersed negative charge of the anion have led to an enhanced neat spin-casted film fluorescence intensity, prolonged fluorescence lifetime, smooth thin film surfaces and a record power photovoltaic efficiency of 3.8 % when compared to organic salts of this particular chromophore containing anions with localised negative charge. Clear evidence is given that a superweak coordinating anion is an emerging key parameter in cyanine dye photochemistry. This approach can be seen as a general guideline to prepare highly efficient ionic dyes for organic semiconductor applications.",,,,,
30469907,Optical properties of molecular nanocrystals consisting of J-aggregates of anionic and cationic cyanine dyes.,"We report results of experimental studies of the photoabsorption, photoluminescent and photoelectric properties of a new type of multilayer molecular nanocrystals, consisting of highly ordered J-aggregates of one anionic and two cationic J-aggregates of cyanine dyes. In contrast to conventional J-aggregated dyes the multichromic nanocrystals synthesized in this work, are capable of efficient light absorption in three excitonic bands of the visible and near-IR spectral ranges. The spectral peak positions in the absorption bands can be controlled by appropriately selecting a set of dyes a molecular crystal is made of. Our investigations of the photoelectric properties of multichromic crystals have shown that each of them can potentially be used as a photosensitive layer of a photocell with photoconductivity in three peaks of excitonic absorption. The synthesized nanocrystals are attractive for the creation of thin-film organic photodetectors with a large photosensitive area and varied photoabsorption spectra, excitonic waveguides and for some other applications in organic and hybrid photonics and optoelectronics.",,,,,
30469460,Counter Anion Effect on the Photophysical Properties of Emissive Indolizine-Cyanine Dyes in Solution and Solid State.,"Near-infrared emissive materials with tunable Stokes shifts and solid-state emissions are needed for several active research areas and applications. To aid in addressing this need, a series of indolizine-cyanine compounds varying only the anions based on size, dipole, and hydrophilicity were prepared. The effect of the non-covalently bound anions on the absorption and emission properties of identical π-system indolizine-cyanine compounds were measured in solution and as thin films. Interestingly, the anion choice has a significant influence on the Stokes shift and molar absorptivities of the dyes in solution. In the solid-state, the anion choice was found to have an effect on the formation of aggregate states with higher energy absorptions than the parent monomer compound. The dyes were found to be emissive in the NIR region, with emissions peaking at near 900 nm for specific solvent and anion selections.",,,"Anions, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Indolizines, Molecular Structure, Solvents, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
30427570,Accurate Determination of Human CPR Conformational Equilibrium by smFRET Using Dual Orthogonal Noncanonical Amino Acid Labeling.,"Conjugation of fluorescent dyes to proteins-a prerequisite for the study of conformational dynamics by single-molecule (sm) FRET-can lead to substantial changes in a dye's photophysical properties, ultimately biasing the determination of inter-dye distances. In particular, cyanine dyes and their derivatives, the most commonly used dyes in smFRET experiments, exhibit such behavior. To overcome this, we developed a general strategy to equip proteins site-specifically with FRET pairs through chemoselective reactions with two distinct noncanonical amino acids simultaneously incorporated through genetic code expansion in Escherichia coli. Application of this technique to human NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) demonstrated the importance of homogenously labeled samples for accurate determination of FRET efficiencies and unveiled the effect of NADP<sup>+</sup> on the ionic-strength-dependent modulation of the conformational equilibrium of CPR. Thanks to its generality and accuracy, the presented methodology establishes a new benchmark for deciphering of complex molecular dynamics in single molecules.",,,"Carbocyanines, Cloning, Molecular, Escherichia coli, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Lysine, Microscopy, Confocal, Molecular Conformation, NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase, Phenylalanine, Single Molecule Imaging",,
30414574,Interaction of a dimeric carbocyanine dye aggregate with bovine serum albumin in non-aggregated and aggregated forms.,"The interaction of fluorescent dyes with serum proteins has garnered significant interest owing to potential for non-covalent labeling and imaging applications. In this work, dimeric benzothiazole-based trimethine cyanine dyes are synthesized and their interaction with bovine serum albumin studied. The dimeric cyanine dyes mainly exist as H-dimers and H-aggregates in aqueous solution. A combination of absorbance, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and atomic force and fluorescence microscopy indicate the formation of dye-BSA complexes. Binding of one of the dimeric dyes on BSA with a K<sub>a</sub> of 1.49×10<sup>5</sup>M<sup>-1</sup> results in disruption of dye self-aggregates and unfolding of the dyes into the monomeric or open conformation. Fluorescence enhancement experienced by the dimeric dyes upon interaction with BSA is superior to that registered by Thioflavin T. Surfactant SDS has been used to further tune the self-aggregation of the dimeric dye resulting in a 200-fold fluorescence enhancement in presence of BSA. Interaction of a dimeric dye with BSA under conditions favoring protein aggregation is found to result in faster dye binding and the resulting fluorescence enhancement is easily visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The interaction of a dimeric cyanine dye aggregate with BSA is promising for non-covalent labeling applications in sharp contrast to the monomeric dye counterpart.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cattle, Circular Dichroism, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Polymers, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Surface-Active Agents",,
30411777,Site-specific near-infrared fluorescent labelling of proteins on cysteine residues with meso-chloro-substituted heptamethine cyanine dyes.,"Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging is a promising new medical imaging modality. Associated with a targeting molecule, NIR fluorophores can accumulate selectively in tissues of interest and become valuable tools for the diagnosis and therapy of various pathologies. To facilitate the design of targeted NIR imaging agents, it is important to identify simple and affordable fluorescent probes, allowing rapid labelling of biovectors such as proteins, ideally in a site-specific manner. Here, we demonstrate that heptamethine cyanine based fluorophores, such as IR-783, that contain a chloro-cyclohexyl moiety within their polymethine chain can react selectively, at neutral pH, with cysteine residues in proteins to give stable, site-specifically labelled conjugates, that emit in the NIR spectral window. This reaction is exemplified with the labelling of peptides and two protein models: albumin and a Fab' antibody fragment. The resulting fluorescent proteins are stable and suitable for in vivo NIR imaging applications, as shown on a mice model. This straightforward one-step procedure, that does not require the prior derivatisation of the fluorophore with a bioconjugatable handle, should facilitate the production and use of near-infrared labelled proteins in life sciences.",,,"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cysteine, Fluorescent Dyes, Halogenation, Infrared Rays, Mice, Optical Imaging, Peptides, Proteins, Staining and Labeling, Tissue Distribution",,

In tissues particularly, heptamethine cyanine dyes (Cy-7) are valuable because they absorb in the near-infrared (NIR) region (750⁻900 nm) where light penetration is maximal. In this work, we found Cy-7 dyes with a <i>meso</i>-Cl functionality covalently binding to proteins with free Cys residues under physiological conditions (aqueous environments, at near neutral pH, and 37 °C). It transpired that the <i>meso</i>-Cl of the dye was displaced by free thiols in protein, while nucleophilic side-chains from amino acids like Tyr, Lys, and Ser did not react.

30397272,Impact of Stokes Shift on the Performance of Near-Infrared Harvesting Transparent Luminescent Solar Concentrators.,"Visibly transparent luminescent solar concentrators (TLSC) have the potential to turn existing infrastructures into net-zero-energy buildings. However, the reabsorption loss currently limits the device performance and scalability. This loss is typically defined by the Stokes shift between the absorption and emission spectra of luminophores. In this work, the Stokes shifts (SS) of near-infrared selective-harvesting cyanines are altered by substitution of the central methine carbon with dialkylamines. We demonstrate varying SS with values over 80 nm and ideal infrared-visible absorption cutoffs. The corresponding TLSC with such modification shows a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.4% for a >25 cm<sup>2</sup> device area with excellent visible transparency >80% and up to 0.6% PCE over smaller areas. However, experiments and simulations show that it is not the Stokes shift that is critical, but the total degree of overlap that depends on the shape of the absorption tails. We show with a series of SS-modulated cyanine dyes that the SS is not necessarily correlated to improvements in performance or scalability. Accordingly, we define a new parameter, the overlap integral, to sensitively correlate reabsorption losses in any LSC. In deriving this parameter, new approaches to improve the scalability and performance are discussed to fully optimize TLSC designs to enhance commercialization efforts.",,,,,
30382099,Structural basis for activation of fluorogenic dyes by an RNA aptamer lacking a G-quadruplex motif.,"The DIR2s RNA aptamer, a second-generation, in-vitro selected binder to dimethylindole red (DIR), activates the fluorescence of cyanine dyes, DIR and oxazole thiazole blue (OTB), allowing detection of two well-resolved emission colors. Using Fab BL3-6 and its cognate hairpin as a crystallization module, we solved the crystal structures of both the apo and OTB-SO<sub>3</sub> bound forms of DIR2s at 2.0 Å and 1.8 Å resolution, respectively. DIR2s adopts a compact, tuning fork-like architecture comprised of a helix and two short stem-loops oriented in parallel to create the ligand binding site through tertiary interactions. The OTB-SO<sub>3</sub> fluorophore binds in a planar conformation to a claw-like structure formed by a purine base-triple, which provides a stacking platform for OTB-SO<sub>3,</sub> and an unpaired nucleotide, which partially caps the binding site from the top.

Using the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set and B3LYP exchange-correlation functional with IEF-PCM (water) solvent, the predicted spectrum achieved a maximum absorbance within 0.007 eV of experiment. An in-house program based on the theoretical model of Kühn, Renger, and May (KRM), which predicts the orientation of dyes within an aggregate from its absorbance and circular dichroism (CD) spectra or vice versa, was used to investigate the orientation of an experimentally observed dimer. The absorbance spectrum predicted using the KRM model of the dimer structure optimized with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set, ωB97XD exchange-correlation functional, and IEF-PCM solvent agrees with experimental data.",,,,,
30354072,On the Mechanisms of Uptake of Tumor-Seeking Cyanine Dyes.,"Molecular entities that localize in tumor tissue are clinically important for targeted delivery of diagnostic, imaging, and therapeutic reagents. Often these targeting entities are designed for specific receptors (e.g., EGFR or integrin receptors). However, there is a subset of cyanine-7 dyes that apparently localize in every type of solid tumor tissue (at least, no exceptions have been reported so far), and they persist there for several days. Consequently, these dyes can be used for near-IR optical imaging of tumors in animal studies, they can be conjugated with cytotoxic species to give experimental theranostics, and there is potential for expanding their use into the development of clinically useful derivatives. Data presented in the literature and in this work indicate that the half-lives of these compounds in serum at 37 °C is on the order of minutes to a few hours, so what accounts for the persistent fluorescence of these dyes in tumor tissue over periods of several days? Literature, solely based on tissue culture experiments featuring a particular receptor blocker, indicates that uptake of these dyes is mediated by the organic anion transporter proteins (OATPs). Data presented in this paper agrees with that conclusion for short-term uptake, but significantly expands understanding of the likely reasons for long-term uptake and persistent tumor localization in vivo.",,,"Benzothiazoles, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Drug Delivery Systems, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Models, Molecular, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Organic Anion Transporters, Serum Albumin, Human",,
30310587,A new structure-activity relationship for cyanine dyes to improve photostability and fluorescence properties for live cell imaging.,"A new set of cyanine-indole dyes was synthesized, characterized by optical and cytotoxic properties and subsequently applied for live cell imaging. Furthermore, these dyes were postsynthetically linked covalently to the 2'-position of uridine anchors in presynthesized oligonucleotides using the copper(i)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition in order to evaluate their photostability and imaging properties in living cells. The nucleophilicity at position C-2 of the indole part of the dyes was elucidated as key for a new structure-activity relationship that served as a rational guide to improve the photostability and optical properties of these green-emitting dyes for live cell imaging of nucleic acids. While the photostability rises exponentially with decreasing nucleophilicity, thermal bleaching experiments confirmed an opposite trend supposing that the superoxide radical anion is mainly responsible for the photobleaching of the dyes. Furthermore, the cytotoxicities of the dyes were tested in HeLa cells and moderate to low LD<sub>50</sub> values were obtained. This interdisciplinary strategy allowed us to identify one dye with excellent optical properties and even better photostability and decreased cytotoxicity compared to a cyanine-indole dye that bears an additional cyclooctatetraene group as a triplet state quencher.",,,,,
30294858,A NanoFlare-Based Strategy for In Situ Tumor Margin Demarcation and Neoadjuvant Gene/Photothermal Therapy.,"Accurate tumor margin demarcation in situ remains a paramount challenge. Herein, a NanoFlare (also known as spherical-nucleic-acid technology) based strategy is reported for in situ tumor margin delineation by transforming and amplifying the pathophysiological redox signals of tumor microenvironment. The NanoFlare designed (named AuNS-ASON) is based on gold nanostar (AuNS) coated with a dense shell of disulfide bridge-inserted and cyanine dyes-labeled antisense oligonucleotides (ASON) targeting survivin mRNA. The unique anisotropic ASON-spike nanostructure endows the AuNS-ASON with universal cellular internalization of tumor cells, while the disulfide bridge inserted confers response specificity toward redox activation. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the AuNS-ASON can discriminate tumor cells rapidly with activated fluorescence signals (>100-fold) in 2 h, and further achieve synergistic gene/photothermal tumor cells ablation upon near-infrared laser irradiation. Remarkably, in situ tumor margin delineation with high accuracy and outstanding spatial resolution (<100 µm) in mice bearing different tumors is obtained based on the AuNS-ASON, providing intraoperative guidance for tumor resection. Moreover, the AuNS-ASON can enable efficient neoadjuvant gene/photothermal therapy before surgery to reduce tumor extent and increase resectability. The concept of NanoFlare-based microenvironment signal transformation and amplification could be used as a general strategy to guide the design of activatable nanoprobes for cancer theranostics.",,,"Gold, Nanocomposites, Neoadjuvant Therapy, Oligonucleotides, Antisense, Oxidation-Reduction, Phototherapy, RNA, Messenger, Survivin, Tumor Microenvironment",,

Here we take advantage of the environment-sensitive photoisomerization of cyanine dyes to probe local and global changes in DNA structure. We report that a covalently attached Cy3 dye undergoes strong enhancement of fluorescence intensity and lifetime when stacked in a nick, gap or overhang region in duplex DNA. This is used to probe hybridization dynamics of a DNA hairpin down to the single-molecule level. We also show that varying the position of a single abasic site up to 20 base pairs away modulates the dye-DNA interaction, indicative of through-backbone allosteric interactions. The phenomenon of stacking-induced fluorescence increase (SIFI) should find widespread use in the study of the structure, dynamics and reactivity of nucleic acids.",,,"Allosteric Regulation, Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Single Molecule Imaging, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
30275915,Insights into photovoltaic properties of ternary organic solar cells from phase diagrams.,"The efficiency of ternary organic solar cells relies on the spontaneous establishment of a nanostructured network of donor and acceptor phases during film formation. A fundamental understanding of phase composition and arrangement and correlations to photovoltaic device parameters is of utmost relevance for both science and technology. We demonstrate a general approach to understanding solar cell behavior from simple thermodynamic principles. For two ternary blend systems we construct and model phase diagrams. Details of EQE and solar cell parameters can be understood from the phase behavior. Our blend system is composed of PC<sub>70</sub>BM, PBDTTT-C and a near-infrared absorbing cyanine dye. Cyanine dyes are accompanied by counterions, which, in a first approximation, do not change the photophysical properties of the dye, but strongly influence the morphology of the ternary blend. We argue that counterion dissociation is responsible for different mixing behavior. For the dye with a hexafluorophosphate counterion a hierarchical morphology develops, the dye phase separates on a large scale from PC<sub>70</sub>BM and cannot contribute to photocurrent. Differently, a cyanine dye with a TRISPHAT counterion shows partial miscibility with PC<sub>70</sub>BM. A large two-phase region dictated by the PC<sub>70</sub>BM: PBDTTT-C mixture is present and the dye greatly contributes to the short-circuit current.",,,,,

The color change and quenching of the dye emission are selective detections of picric acid at nanomolar concentration is accomplished in water medium without having any interference from other NAC's. The protonation and deprotonation between N,N-dimethylaniline, and N,N-diethyl aniline units will prompt to the changes in the targeted ICT molecules and the emission response can be detected on distinct NAC. The dyes C1 and C2 set out towards NACs was explored in the THF-H<sub>2</sub>O medium by UV-vis and fluorescence spectra situated around 560 nm with high molar absorption coefficient. NMR spectroscopic titrations in DMSO‑d<sub>6</sub> for affirming the interface between the picric acid with C1 <sup>1</sup>H NMR was utilized to confirm our proposed mechanism.

Herein, a series of heptamethine cyanines containing modified methine bridges were synthesized using substituted dianil linkers. Their optical properties including, molar absorptivity, fluorescence, and quantum yield were measured as well as their hydrophobic effects in polar buffer solution.

30187756,Near Length-Independent Conductance in Polymethine Molecular Wires.,"Polymethine dyes are linear π-conjugated compounds with an odd number of carbons that display a much greater delocalization in comparison to polyenes that have an even number of carbon atoms in their main chain. Herein, we perform scanning tunneling microscope based break-junction measurements on a series of three cyanine dyes of increasing length. We demonstrate, at the single molecule level, that these short chain polymethine systems exhibit a substantially smaller decay in conductance with length (attenuation factor β = 0.04 Å<sup>-1</sup>) compared to traditional polyenes (β ≈ 0.2 Å<sup>-1</sup>). Furthermore, we show that by changing solvent we are able to shift the β value, demonstrating a remarkable negative β value, with conductance increasing with molecular length. First principle calculations provide support for the experimentally observed near-uniform length dependent conductance and further suggest that the variations in β with solvent are due to solvent-induced changes in the alignment of the frontier molecular orbitals relative to the Fermi energy of the leads. A simplified Hückel model suggests that the smaller decay in conductance correlates with the smaller degree of bond order alternation present in polymethine compounds compared to polyenes. These findings may enable the design of molecular wires without a length-dependent decay for efficient electron transport at the nanoscale.",,,,,

However, the existing NIR-II fluorescent agents, including many molecular dyes and inorganic nanomaterials, are primarily focused on complicated synthesis routes and unknown immunogenic responses with limited potential for clinical translation. Herein, the >1000 nm tail emission of conventional biocompatible NIR cyanine dyes with emission peaks at 700-900 nm is systematically investigated, and a type of bright dye for NIR-II imaging with high potential for accelerating clinical translation is identified. The asymmetry of the π domain in the S<sub>1</sub> state of NIR cyanine dyes is proven to result in a twisted intramolecular charge-transfer process and NIR-II emission, establishing a general rule to guide future NIR-I/II fluorophore synthesis. The screened NIR dyes are identified to possess a bright emission tail in the NIR-II region along with high quantum yield, high molar-extinction coefficient, rapid fecal excretion, and functional groups amenable for bioconjugation. As a result, NIR cyanine dyes can be used for NIR-II imaging to afford superior contrast and real-time imaging of several biological models, facilitating the translation of NIR-II bioimaging to clinical theranostic applications.",,,,,
29975386,Tubular J-aggregates of a new thiacarbocyanine Cy5 dye for the far-red spectral region - a spectroscopic and cryo-transmission electron microscopy study.,"The aggregation behavior of a phenol-substituted thiacarbocyanine Cy5 dye (5-chloro-2-[5-[5-chloro-3-(4-sulfobutyl)-3H-benzothiazol-2-ylidene]-3-phenyl-penta-1,3-dienyl]-3-(4-sulfobutyl)-benzothiazol-3-ium hydroxide, inner salt, triethylammonium salt) in aqueous solution is investigated using steady-state absorption, linear dichroism, and fluorescence spectroscopies, as well as cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). By increasing the concentration, the dye self-assembles in pure water into dimers and H-aggregates, the latter being uniform particles of ∼2.6 nm size. In the presence of NaCl, two different types of J-aggregates are observed depending on salt concentration (varied from 10 to 100 mM). At low salt concentration (10 mM) a J-aggregate of extended mono-layered sheets prevails, which disappears after a few days, whereas a second type of J-aggregate emerges. Generally, the latter dominates in matured solutions in particular at high salt concentration and seems to be the thermodynamically stable species. This J-aggregate shows three perpendicularly polarized absorption bands and fluoresces in the far-red at around 800 nm. The most intensive and very narrow (fwhm of 238 cm-1) absorption band is centered at 796 nm. Cryo-TEM reveals uniform nanotubes of ∼7 nm diameter and micrometer length. They represent the first tubular cyanine dye J-aggregates that are active in the far-red. Moreover, the studied dye is a prime example of cyanine dyes showing two self-assembly pathways that lead to different species of J-aggregates with distinct optical and morphological properties.",,,,,
29972713,A Far-Red Fluorescent DNA Binder for Interaction Studies of Live Multidrug-Resistant Pathogens and Host Cells.,"Transgene expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) has facilitated the spatiotemporal investigation of host-pathogen interactions; however, introduction of the GFP gene remains challenging in drug-resistant bacteria. Herein, we report a novel far-red fluorescent nucleic acid stain, 6-TramTO-3, which efficiently labels bacteria through a DNA binding mode without affecting growth and viability. Exemplarily, we stained Klebsiella pneumoniae, a major threat to hospitalized patients, and deciphered divergent interaction strategies of antibiotic-resistant and antibiotic-sensitive Klebsiella strains with immune cells. 6-TramTO-3 constitutes an off-the-shelf reagent for real-time analysis of bacterial infection, including strains for which the use of genetically encoded reporters is not feasible. Eventually, our approach may aid the development of strategies to combat a major worldwide health threat: multidrug-resistant bacteria.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Bacterial, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Klebsiella Infections, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Macrophages, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Staining and Labeling",,
29958414,Loading IR820 Using Multifunctional Dendrimers with Enhanced Stability and Specificity.,"Cyanine dyes are promising candidates in biomedical applications. Although various delivery systems have been developed to enhance their properties, their dendrimer-based delivery systems are seldom investigated. Herein, amine-terminated generation 5 poly(amidoamine) (G5.NH₂) dendrimers and new indocyanine green (IR820) dyes were chosen as models to study the loading ability of dendrimers for cyanine dynes. G5.NH₂ dendrimers were pre-modified with arginine-glycine-aspartic (RGD) peptides, poly(ethylene glycol) chains, and acetyl groups to be endowed with cancer cell specificity and biocompatibility. The formed Ac-PR dendrimers were used to load IR820, followed by thorough characterization. The loaded number of IR820 was estimated to be 6.7 per dendrimer. The stability of IR820 was improved through dendrimer loading, which was proved by their UV-vis spectra under different kinds of storage conditions. In addition, the formed Ac-PR dendrimers can retain the loaded IR820 effectively. Their cytocompatibility was desirable under the studied conditions. Their cellular uptake behaviors were demonstrated to be enhanced by RGD modification, showing concentration-, co-incubation time-, and &alpha;<sub>v</sub>&beta;₃ integrin receptor-dependent properties, displaying a cytoplasm-location. The findings from this work demonstrated the versatile loading and delivery capacity of dendrimers for near-infrared (NIR) dyes, providing fundamental data for the development of dendrimer/NIR dye systems for biomedical applications, especially for cancer theranostic applications.",,,,,
29953208,PEI-NIR Heptamethine Cyanine Nanotheranostics for Tumor Targeted Gene Delivery.,"Polymer-based nanotheranostics are appealing tools for cancer treatment and diagnosis in the fast-growing field of nanomedicine. A straightforward preparation of novel engineered PEI-based nanotheranostics incorporating NIR fluorescence heptamethine cyanine dyes (NIRF-HC) to enable them with tumor targeted gene delivery capabilities is reported. Branched PEI-2 kDa (b2kPEI) is conjugated with IR-780 and IR-783 dyes by both covalent and noncovalent simple preparative methodologies varying their stoichiometry ratio. The as-prepared set of PEI-NIR-HC nanocarriers are assayed in vitro and in vivo to evaluate their gene transfection efficiency, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, internalization and trafficking mechanisms, subcellular distribution, and tumor specific gene delivery. The results show the validity of the approach particularly for one of the covalent IR783-b2kPEI conjugates that exhibit an enhanced tumor uptake, probably mediated by organic anion transporting peptides, and favorable intracellular transport to the nucleus. The compound behaves as an efficient nanotheranostic transfection agent in NSG mice bearing melanoma G361 xenographs with concomitant imaging signal and gene concentration in the targeted tumor. By this way, advanced nanotheranostics with multifunctional capabilities (gene delivery, tumor-specific targeting, and NIR fluorescence imaging) are generated in which the NIRF-HC dye component accounts for simultaneous targeting and diagnostics, avoiding additional incorporation of additional tumor-specific targeting bioligands.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Fluorescence, Gene Transfer Techniques, Mice, Nanomedicine, Polyethyleneimine, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Theranostic Nanomedicine",,
29888360,The influence of aggregation on the third-order nonlinear optical property of π-conjugated chromophores: the case of cyanine dyes.,"The external molecular environment like the aggregation of molecules can significantly change the intrinsic third-order nonlinear optical (NLO) property of π-conjugated chromophores. A combined experimental and theoretical study was performed to understand the influence of the aggregation of cyanines on the third-order NLO property in spin-coated thin films. Our result indicates that the H and J type cyanine dimers prefer the polyene-like structures and the P type dimer displays a comparatively smaller bond length alternation (BLA). The polarizable continuum model (PCM)-tuned, range-separated (RSE) density functional approach was used to describe the screening effect of the cyanine aggregation. In the thin film, the P aggregate has very small positive isotropic averaged second hyperpolarizability γ, while the J aggregate has the largest positive γ due to the most polarized face-to-tail cyanine-cyanine interaction. Hence, the γ of the isolated cyanines (negative γ) may get cancelled against that of the cyanine aggregates (positive γ) in the thin film. The forward degenerate four-wave mixing technique also confirms a decrease in the magnitude of γ with an increase in the aggregation degree of cyanines. Since the large positive γ of the cyanine also implies strong two-photon absorption (TPA), the J aggregation of cyanines can be used as a potential fabrication method for applications involving TPA.",,,,,
29845158,Carbon coated core-shell multifunctional fluorescent SPIONs.,"Due to their unique magnetic properties, multiple surface functionality and biocompatibility, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) show very promising characteristics as magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents in biomedical applications. However, a lack of fluorescence makes SPIONs inappropriate for multimodal bioimaging. SPIONs surface functionalized by either organic fluorescent molecules or semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have been reported as bioimaging probes but subsequent deterioration of the fluorescent dyes due to low photostability and quick photobleaching limits their long term practical application. In addition, QDs are found to be toxic in nature. Here, we present a novel one step method to synthesize non-toxic carbon coated highly photostable core-shell magnetic and fluorescent SPIONs with long-lasting fluorescence alongside a superior magnetic resonance (MR) imaging ability. Apart from the highly comparable superparamagnetic properties of the SPIONs, the optical response of the material is much better than commonly used Rhodamine or cyanine dyes.",,,,,

The comparative <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> screening of naphthalocyanines and cyanine dyes has shown a substitution pattern dependent shift in photoacoustic excitation wavelength, with distal substitution producing the preferred maximum around 800 nm. Central ion change showed variable production of photoacoustic signals, as well as singlet oxygen photoproduction and fluorescence with the optimum for photoacoustic imaging being nickel(II). Our approach paves the way for the design, evaluation and realization of optimized sonochromes as photoacoustic contrast agents.",,,,,
29698610,Optical Properties of Vibronically Coupled Cy3 Dimers on DNA Scaffolds.,"We examine the effect of electronic coupling on the optical properties of Cy3 dimers attached to DNA duplexes as a function of base pair (bp) separation using steady-state and time-resolved spectroscopy. For close Cy3-Cy3 separations, 0 and 1 bp between dyes, intermediate to strong electronic coupling is revealed by modulation of the absorption and fluorescence properties including spectral band shape, peak wavelength, and excited-state lifetime. Using a vibronic exciton model, we estimate coupling strengths of 150 and 266 cm<sup>-1</sup> for the 1 and 0 bp separations, respectively, which are comparable to those found in natural light-harvesting complexes. For the strongest electronic coupling (0 bp separation), we observe that the absorption band shape is strongly affected by the base pairs that surround the dyes, where more strongly hydrogen-bonded G-C pairs produce a red-shifted absorption spectrum consistent with a J-type dimer. This effect is studied theoretically using molecular dynamics simulation, which predicts an in-line dye configuration that is consistent with the experimental J-type spectrum. When the Cy3 dimers are in a standard aqueous buffer, the presence of relatively strong electronic coupling is accompanied by decreased fluorescence lifetime, suggesting that it promotes nonradiative relaxation in cyanine dyes. However, we show that the use of a viscous solvent can suppress this nonradiative recombination and thereby restore the dimer fluorescent emission. Ultrafast transient absorption measurements of Cy3 dimers in both standard aqueous buffer and viscous glycerol buffer suggest that sufficiently strong electronic coupling increases the probability of excited-state relaxation through a dark state that is related to Cy3 torsional motion.",,,"Base Pairing, Carbocyanines, DNA, Dimerization, Hydrogen Bonding, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

29635727,Reverse Solvatochromism of Imine Dyes Comprised of 5-Nitrofuran-2-yl or 5-Nitrothiophen-2-yl as Electron Acceptor and Phenolate as Electron Donor.,"Eight compounds with phenols as electron-donating groups and 5-nitrothiophen-2-yl or 5-nitrofuran-2-yl acceptor moieties in their molecular structures were synthesized. The crystalline structures of six compounds were obtained. Their corresponding phenolate dyes were studied in 29 solvents and the data showed that in all cases a reverse solvatochromism occurred. The results are explained in terms of the ability of the medium to stabilize the electronic ground and excited states of the probes to different extents. The frontier molecular orbitals were analyzed for the protonated and deprotonated forms of the compounds. The calculated geometries are in agreement with the X-ray structures determined for the compounds and it was verified that after their deprotonation an increase in the electron delocalization occurs. Radial distribution functions were calculated for the dyes in water and n-hexane to analyze different solvation patterns resulting from the interaction of the solvents with the dyes. Data obtained by using the Catalán multiparameter equation revealed that the medium acidity is responsible for hypsochromic shifts, whereas the solvent basicity, polarizability, and dipolarity contributed to bathochromic shifts of the solvatochromic band of these dyes. Two model ""hybrid cyanine"" dyes were used in the design of simple experiments to demonstrate that the solvatochromic behavior of these dyes in solution can be tuned with careful consideration of the properties of the medium.",,,,,

Four sulfonate-based anions and the bulky bistriflylimide anion are introduced to the 2-[5-(1,3-dihydro-1,3,3-trimethyl-2H-indol-2-ylidene)-1,3-pentadien-1-yl]-1,3,3-trimethyl-3H-indolium chromophore using an Amberlyst A26 (OH<sup>-</sup> form) anion exchanger. Anionic charge distribution clearly correlates with device performance, whereby an average efficiency of 2% was reached in a standard bilayer organic solar. Evidence is given that the negative charge of the anion distributed over a large number of atoms is significantly more important than the size of the organic moieties of the sulfonate charge carrying group. This provides a clear strategy for future design of more efficient cyanine dyes for OPV applications.",,,,,
29593951,Enhanced Photodynamic Cancer Treatment by Mitochondria-Targeting and Brominated Near-Infrared Fluorophores.,"A noninvasive and selective therapy, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely researched in clinical fields; however, the lower efficiency of PDT can induce unexpected side effects. Mitochondria are extensively researched as target sites to maximize PDT effects because they play crucial roles in metabolism and can be used as cancer markers due to their high transmembrane potential. Here, a mitochondria targeting photodynamic therapeutic agent (MitDt) is developed. This photosensitizer is synthesized from heptamethine cyanine dyes, which are conjugated or modified as follows. The heptamethine meso-position is conjugated with a triphenylphosphonium derivative for mitochondrial targeting, the <i>N</i>-alkyl side chain is modified for regulation of charge balance and solubility, and the indolenine groups are brominated to enhance reactive oxygen species generation (ROS) after laser irradiation. The synthesized MitDt increases the cancer uptake efficiency due to the lipo-cationic properties of the triphenylphosphonium, and the PDT effects of MitDt are amplified after laser irradiation because mitochondria are susceptible to ROS, the response to which triggers an apoptotic anticancer effect. Consequently, these hypotheses are demonstrated by in vitro and in vivo studies, and the results indicate strong potential for use of MitDts as efficient single-molecule-based PDT agents for cancer treatment.",,,,,
29570093,Synthesis of highly stable cyanine-dye-doped silica nanoparticle for biological applications.,"Cyanine dyes are widely used in biological labeling and imaging because of their narrow near infrared emission, good brightness and high flexibility in functionalization, which not only enables multiplex analysis and multi-color imaging, but also greatly reduces autofluorescence from biological matter and increases signal-to-noise ratio. Unfortunately, their poor chemical- and photo-stability strongly limits their applications. The incorporation of cyanine dyes in silica nanoparticles provides a solution to the problem. On one hand, the incorporation of cyanine dyes in silica matrix can enhance their chemical- and photo-stability and increase brightness of the nanomaterials. On the other hand, silica matrix provides an optimized condition to host the dye, which helps to maintain their fluorescent properties during application. In addition, the well-established silane technique provides numerous functionalities for diverse applications. However, commercially available cyanine dyes are not very stable at high alkaline conditions, which will gradually lose their fluorescence over time. Our results showed that cyanine dyes are very vulnerable in the reverse micelle system, in which they will lose their fluorescence in less than half an hour. The existence of surfactant could greatly promote degradation of cyanine dyes. Fluorescent silica nanoparticles cannot be obtained at the high alkaline condition with the existence of surfactant. In contrast, the cyanine dyes are relatively stable in Stöber media. Owing to the fast formation of silica particles in Stöber media, the exposure time of cyanine dye in alkaline solution was greatly reduced, and highly fluorescent particles with good morphology and size distribution could be obtained via Stöber approach. However, the increasing water content in the Stöber could reduce the stability of cyanine dyes, which should be avoided. This research here provides a clear guidance on how to successfully synthesize cyanine dye-doped silica nanoparticles with good morphology, size distribution, stability and brightness.",,,"Carbocyanines, Humans, Nanoparticles, Silicon Dioxide",,

All investigated dyes from the series are either not fluorescent or their fluorescence is quite low, but they become strongly fluorescent after binding to dsDNA.

29449447,Tracers for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery: How Elongation of the Polymethine Chain in Cyanine Dyes Alters the Pharmacokinetics of a Dual-Modality c[RGDyK] Tracer.,"The potential of receptor-mediated fluorescence-based image-guided surgery tracers is generally linked to the near-infrared emission profile and good-manufacturing-production availability of fluorescent dyes. Surprisingly, little is known about the critical interaction between the structural composition of the dyes and the pharmacokinetics of the tracers. In this study, a dual-modality tracer design was used to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the influence of elongation of the polymethine chain in a fluorescent cyanine dye on the imaging potential of a targeted tracer. <b>Methods:</b> As a model system, the integrin marker α<sub>v</sub>β<sub>3</sub> was targeted using arginylglycylaspartisc acid [RGD]-based vectors functionalized with a <sup>111</sup>In-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate and a fluorescent dye: (Cy3-(SO<sub>3</sub>)methyl-COOH [emission wavelength (λ<sub>em</sub>), 580 nm], Cy5-(SO<sub>3</sub>)methyl-COOH [λ<sub>em</sub>, 680 nm], or Cy7-(SO<sub>3</sub>)methyl-COOH [λ<sub>em</sub>, 780 nm]). Tracers were analyzed for differences in photophysical properties, serum protein binding, chemical or optical stability, and signal penetration through tissue. Receptor affinities were evaluated using saturation and competition experiments. In vivo biodistribution (SPECT imaging and percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and complemented with in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence images obtained using a clinical-grade multispectral fluorescence laparoscope. <b>Results:</b> Two carbon-atom-step variations in the polymethine chain of the fluorescent cyanine dyes were shown to significantly influence the chemical and photophysical characteristics (e.g., stability, brightness, and tissue penetration) of the hybrid RGD tracers. DTPA-Cy5-(SO<sub>3</sub>)methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] structurally outperformed its Cy3 and Cy7 derivatives. Radioactivity-based evaluation of in vivo tracer pharmacokinetics yielded the lowest nonspecific uptake and highest tumor-to-background ratio for DTPA-Cy5-(SO<sub>3</sub>)methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] (13.2 ± 1.7), with the Cy3 and Cy7 analogs trailing at respective tumor-to-background ratios of 5.7 ± 0.7 and 4.7 ± 0.7. Fluorescence-based assessment of tumor visibility revealed a similar trend. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings underline that variations in the polymethine chain lengths of cyanine dyes have a profound influence on the photophysical properties, stability, and in vivo targeting capabilities of fluorescent imaging tracers. In a direct comparison, the intermediate-length dye (Cy5) yielded a superior c[RGDyK] tracer, compared with the shorter (Cy3) and longer (Cy7) analogs.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Mice, Oligopeptides, Optical Imaging, Radioactive Tracers, Surgery, Computer-Assisted, Tissue Distribution, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,
29443093,Determining if DNA Stained with a Cyanine Dye Can Be Digested with Restriction Enzymes.,"Visualization of DNA for fluorescence microscopy utilizes a variety of dyes such as cyanine dyes. These dyes are utilized due to their high affinity and sensitivity for DNA. In order to determine if the DNA molecules are full length after the completion of the experiment, a method is required to determine if the stained molecules are full length by digesting DNA with restriction enzymes. However, stained DNA may inhibit the enzymes, so a method is needed to determine what enzymes one could use for fluorochrome stained DNA. In this method, DNA is stained with a cyanine dye overnight to allow the dye and DNA to equilibrate. Next, stained DNA is digested with a restriction enzyme, loaded into a gel and electrophoresed. The experimental DNA digest bands are compared to an in silico digest to determine the restriction enzyme activity. If there is the same number of bands as expected, then the reaction is complete. More bands than expected indicate partial digestion and less bands indicate incomplete digestion. The advantage of this method is its simplicity and it uses equipment that a scientist would need for a restriction enzyme assay and gel electrophoresis. A limitation of this method is that the enzymes available to most scientists are commercially available enzymes; however, any restriction enzymes could be used.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, DNA Restriction Enzymes, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans",,

29275633,Tailoring Photoisomerization Pathways in Donor-Acceptor Stenhouse Adducts: The Role of the Hydroxy Group.,"Donor-acceptor Stenhouse adducts (DASAs) are a rapidly emerging class of visible light-activatable negative photochromes. They are closely related to (mero)cyanine dyes with the sole difference being a hydroxy group in the polyene chain. The presence or absence of the hydroxy group has far-reaching consequences for the photochemistry of the compound: cyanine dyes are widely used as fluorescent probes, whereas DASAs hold great promise for visible light-triggered photoswitching. Here we analyze the photophysical properties of a DASA lacking the hydroxy group. Ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy in both the visible and IR region show the occurrence of E-Z photoisomerization on a 20 ps time scale, similar to the photochemical behavior of DASAs, but on a slower time scale. In contrast to the parent DASA compounds, where the initial photoisomerization is constrained to a single position (next to the hydroxy group), <sup>1</sup>H NMR in situ-irradiation studies at 213 K reveal that for nonhydroxy DASAs E-Z photoisomerization can take place at two different bonds, yielding two distinct isomers. These observations are supported by TD-DFT calculations, showing that in the excited state the hydroxy group (pre)selects the neighboring C<sub>2</sub>-C<sub>3</sub> bond for isomerization. The TD-DFT analysis also explains the larger solvatochromic shift observed for the parent DASAs as compared to the nonhydroxy analogue, in terms of the dipole moment changes evoked upon excitation. Furthermore, computations provide helpful insights into the photoswitching energetics, indicating that without the hydroxy group the 4π-electrocyclization step is energetically forbidden. Our results establish the central role of the hydroxy group for DASA photoswitching and suggest that its introduction allows for tailoring photoisomerization pathways, presumably both through (steric) fixation via a hydrogen bond with the adjacent carbonyl group of the acceptor moiety, as well as through electronic effects on the polyene backbone. These insights are essential for the rational design of novel, improved DASA photoswitches and for a better understanding of the properties of both DASAs and cyanine dyes.",,,,,
29266605,Fine Structure in Electronic Spectra of Cyanine Dyes: Are Sub-Bands Largely Determined by a Dominant Vibration or a Collection of Singly Excited Vibrations?,"This work critically examines attempts to model the fine structure apparent in electronic spectra of cyanine dyes and their analogues. Numerous computational studies reported over the past decade attribute the origin of sub-bands and their relative intensities to vibronic transitions in which the relevant electronic transition is coupled, irrespective of symmetry, with a collection of vibrations. It is contended that this type of approach is not supported by experimental evidence. An argument is reiterated for a more appropriate model that adheres closely to fundamental principles and fits the data. It stipulates that essentially just one symmetric vibration, carbon-carbon bond stretching of the cyanine polymethine chain, dominates the coupling and is responsible for the observed fine structure. Furthermore, it is pointed out that the intensities of the sub-bands are readily explained by means of the Franck-Condon principle.",,,,,
29261287,Plexcitons: The Role of Oscillator Strengths and Spectral Widths in Determining Strong Coupling.,"Strong coupling interactions between plasmon and exciton-based excitations have been proposed to be useful in the design of optoelectronic systems. However, the role of various optical parameters dictating the plasmon-exciton (plexciton) interactions is less understood. Herein, we propose an inequality for achieving strong coupling between plasmons and excitons through appropriate variation of their oscillator strengths and spectral widths. These aspects are found to be consistent with experiments on two sets of free-standing plexcitonic systems obtained by (i) linking fluorescein isothiocyanate on Ag nanoparticles of varying sizes through silane coupling and (ii) electrostatic binding of cyanine dyes on polystyrenesulfonate-coated Au nanorods of varying aspect ratios. Being covalently linked on Ag nanoparticles, fluorescein isothiocyanate remains in monomeric state, and its high oscillator strength and narrow spectral width enable us to approach the strong coupling limit. In contrast, in the presence of polystyrenesulfonate, monomeric forms of cyanine dyes exist in equilibrium with their aggregates: Coupling is not observed for monomers and H-aggregates whose optical parameters are unfavorable. The large aggregation number, narrow spectral width, and extremely high oscillator strength of J-aggregates of cyanines permit effective delocalization of excitons along the linear assembly of chromophores, which in turn leads to efficient coupling with the plasmons. Further, the results obtained from experiments and theoretical models are jointly employed to describe the plexcitonic states, estimate the coupling strengths, and rationalize the dispersion curves. The experimental results and the theoretical analysis presented here portray a way forward to the rational design of plexcitonic systems attaining the strong coupling limits.",,,,,

29218343,Cyanine dyes as ratiometric fluorescence standards for the far-red spectral region.,"Most quantitative fluorescence measurements report emission quantum yields by referring the integrated fluorescence profile to that of a well-known standard compound measured under carefully controlled conditions.

Commercial fluorescence spectrophotometers tend to perform very well at wavelengths between 250 and 650 nm but are less responsive at longer wavelengths. There are no recognized emission standards for the far-red region. We now report fluorescence quantum yields for a series of commercially available cyanine dyes in methanol solution at room temperature. The compounds are selected to span the wavelength region from 600 to 850 nm, with absolute emission quantum yields being determined by thermal blooming spectrometry.

Such awareness is a key prerequisite before introduction into clinical settings.",,,"Animals, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Humans, Liver, Nanoparticles, Squalene",,
29166537,Database of Absorption and Fluorescence Spectra of >300 Common Compounds for use in PhotochemCAD.,"The design of new molecules for photochemical studies typically requires knowledge of spectral features of pertinent chromophores beginning with the absorption spectrum (λ<sub>abs</sub> ) and accompanying molar absorption coefficient (ε, m<sup>-1 </sup> cm<sup>-1</sup> ) and often extending to the fluorescence spectrum (λ<sub>em</sub> ) and fluorescence quantum yield (Φ<sub>f</sub> ), where the fluorescence properties may be of direct relevance or useful as proxies to gain insight into the nature of the first excited singlet state. PhotochemCAD databases, developed over a period of 30 years, are described here. The previous databases for 150 compounds have been expanded to encompass 339 compounds for which absorption spectra (including ε values), fluorescence spectra (including Φ<sub>f</sub> values) and references to the primary literature have been included where available (552 spectra altogether). The compounds exhibit spectra in the ultraviolet, visible and/or near-infrared spectral regions. The compound classes and number of members include acridines (21), aromatic hydrocarbons (41), arylmethane dyes (11), azo dyes (18), biomolecules (18), chlorins/bacteriochlorins (16), coumarins (14), cyanine dyes (19), dipyrrins (7), heterocycles (26), miscellaneous dyes (13), oligophenylenes (13), oligopyrroles (6), perylenes (5), phthalocyanines (11), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (16), polyenes/polyynes (10), porphyrins (34), quinones (24) and xanthenes (15).

28991477,Unsymmetrical Relaxation Paths of the Excited States in Cyanine Dyes Detected by Time-Resolved Fluorescence: Polymethinic and Polyenic Forms.,"Novel applications of organic dyes and vast opportunities for their molecular tailoring keep the focus of the scientific community on the issues of symmetry breaking in the systems having different location of uncompensated charge, which has tremendous impact on photoluminescent properties of the dyes. In this article, we provide distinctive experimental evidence of three relaxation paths (one symmetrical and two unsymmetrical) of excited states by analysis of lifetime and spectra of time-resolved fluorescence at low temperature with strong support of quantum-chemical modeling. Importantly, the studied cyanine dye (astraphloxin) in aqueous solution has two different unsymmetrical relaxation paths of excited states in the polymethinic and donor-acceptor polyenic forms, where the last form strongly diminishes in less polar media. The experimental and computational results provide essential fundamental knowledge of molecular electronic relaxations substantially affected by matrix rigidity and polarity for design and photonic applications of elongated π-electronic systems.",,,,,
28980731,Structure-Guided Design and Synthesis of a Mitochondria-Targeting Near-Infrared Fluorophore with Multimodal Therapeutic Activities.,"An urgent challenge for imaging-guided disease-targeted multimodal therapy is to develop the appropriate multifunctional agents to meet the requirements for potential applications. Here, a rigid cyclohexenyl substitution in the middle of a polymethine linker and two asymmetrical amphipathic N-alkyl side chains to indocyanine green (ICG) (the only FDA-approved NIR contrast agent) are introduced, and a new analog, IR-DBI, is developed with simultaneous cancer-cell mitochondrial targeting, NIR imaging, and chemo-/PDT/PTT/multimodal therapeutic activities. The asymmetrical and amphipathic structural modification renders IR-DBI a close binding to albumin protein site II to form a drug-protein complex and primarily facilitates its preferential accumulation at tumor sites via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. The released IR-DBI dye is further actively taken up by cancer cells through organic-anion-transporting polypeptide transporters, and the lipophilic cationic property leads to its selective accumulation in the mitochondria of cancer cells. Finally, based on the high albumin-binding affinity, IR-DBI is modified into human serum albumin (HSA) via self-assembly to produce a nanosized complex, which exhibits significant improvement in the cancer targeting and multimodal cancer treatment with better biocompatibility. This finding may present a practicable strategy to develop small-molecule-based cancer theranostic agents for simultaneous cancer diagnostics and therapeutics.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indocyanine Green, Mitochondria, Neoplasms, Theranostic Nanomedicine",,

Here we adapt the Peyrard-Bishop mesoscopic model to incorporate cyanine dyes and use the technique of thermal equivalence to obtain the appropriate parameters from existing melting temperatures. We have found that the stacking parameters are in the same range of ordinary AT and CG base pairs, in particular Cy3-A was found to be most rigidly stacked.

28914610,Fluorescent J-aggregates of cyanine dyes: basic research and applications review.,"J-aggregates are fascinating fluorescent nanomaterials formed by highly ordered assembly of organic dyes with the spectroscopic properties dramatically different from that of single or disorderly assembled dye molecules. They demonstrate very narrow red-shifted absorption and emission bands, strongly increased absorbance together with the decrease of radiative lifetime, highly polarized emission and other valuable features. The mechanisms of their electronic transitions are understood by formation of delocalized excitons already on the level of several coupled monomers. Cyanine dyes are unique in forming J-aggregates over the broad spectral range, from blue to near-IR. With the aim to inspire further developments, this review is focused on the optical characteristics of J-aggregates in connection with the dye structures and on their diverse already realized and emerging applications.",,,,,
28853453,Thiophene bridged hydrocyanine - a new fluorogenic ROS probe.,"Hydrocyanines are a class of commonly used reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescent imaging probes, which can image ROS in cell culture, organ culture, and in vivo. However, despite their widespread use, hydrocyanines have several drawbacks that limit their effectiveness, such as a high rate of auto-oxidation, a small Stokes shift, and poor water solubility. In addition, the hydrocyanines oxidize into cyanine dyes, which themselves decompose in the presence of ROS, and this further lowers their sensitivity towards detecting ROS. In this report, we present a new hydrocyanine analog, termed as thiophene-bridged hydrocyanine (TBHC), which has its double bonds replaced with a bisthiophene. TBHC is 8.06-fold more stable to auto-oxidation than the hydrocyanine hydro-Cy5 and is significantly better at imaging ROS in cell culture.",,,,,
28791769,Fluorescent Polymer Nanoparticles for Cell Barcoding In Vitro and In Vivo.,"Fluorescent polymer nanoparticles for long-term labeling and tracking of living cells with any desired color code are developed. They are built from biodegradable poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) polymer loaded with cyanine dyes (DiO, DiI, and DiD) with the help of bulky fluorinated counterions, which minimize aggregation-caused quenching. At the single particle level, these particles are ≈20-fold brighter than quantum dots of similar color. Due to their identical 40 nm size and surface properties, these nanoparticles are endocytosed equally well by living cells. Mixing nanoparticles of three colors in different proportions generates a homogeneous RGB (red, green, and blue) barcode in cells, which is transmitted through many cell generations. Cell barcoding is validated on 7 cell lines (HeLa, KB, embryonic kidney (293T), Chinese hamster ovary, rat basophilic leucemia, U97, and D2A1), 13 color codes, and it enables simultaneous tracking of co-cultured barcoded cell populations for >2 weeks. It is also applied to studying competition among drug-treated cell populations. This technology enabled six-color imaging in vivo for (1) tracking xenografted cancer cells and (2) monitoring morphogenesis after microinjection in zebrafish embryos. In addition to a robust method of multicolor cell labeling and tracking, this work suggests that multiple functions can be co-localized inside cells by combining structurally close nanoparticles carrying different functions.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Survival, Cell Tracking, Color, Embryo, Nonmammalian, Fluorescence, HeLa Cells, Humans, Mice, Nanoparticles, Polymers, Zebrafish",,

The dyes were found to be weakly fluorescent in the unbound state, whereas upon the binding to dsDNA or RNA their emission intensity raised up to 50 times (for monomethine benzothiazole derivative FT1 complexed with RNA). The strongest fluorescence intensity in assemblies with dsDNA and RNA was observed for the trimethine benzothiazole derivative FT4. The quantum yield of FT4 fluorescence in its complex with dsDNA was found to be 1.5% and the binding constant (K <sub>b</sub>) was estimated to be 7.9 × 10<sup>4</sup> M<sup>-1</sup> that is a typical value for intercalating molecules. The FT4 dye was found to be cell membrane permeable. It stains RNA rich components-the nucleoli and most probably the cytoplasmic RNA. FT4 bound to RNAs delivers a very strong fluorescence signal, which makes this easily accessible dye a potentially useful alternative to known RNA stains, e.g. expensive SYTO<sup>®</sup> 83. The advantage of FT4 is its easy synthetic access including no chromatographic purification steps, which will be reflected in its substantially lower price.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, HL-60 Cells, HeLa Cells, Humans, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Phenanthrolines, RNA, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

Fluorescently labeled nucleoside triphosphates were studied as substrates using multiplex PCR with Taq and Vent (exo-) DNA polymerases, the typical representatives of the A and B polymerase families. The efficiency of nucleotide incorporation during PCR was assessed with a multi-parameter hybridization analysis using a diagnostic DNA microarray.

28741598,Plasmonic enhancement of cyanine dyes for near-infrared light-triggered photodynamic/photothermal therapy and fluorescent imaging.,"Near-infrared (NIR) triggered cyanine dyes have attracted considerable attention in multimodal tumor theranostics. However, NIR cyanine dyes used in tumor treatment often suffer from low fluorescence intensity and weak singlet oxygen generation efficiency, resulting in inadequate diagnostic and therapy efficacy for tumors. It is still a great challenge to improve both the photodynamic therapy (PDT) and fluorescent imaging (FLI) efficacy of cyanine dyes in tumor applications. Herein, a novel multifunctional nanoagent AuNRs@SiO<sub>2</sub>-IR795 was developed to realize the integrated photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) and FLI at a very low dosage of IR795 (0.4 μM) based on metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) effects. In our design, both the fluorescence intensity and reactive oxygen species of AuNRs@SiO<sub>2</sub>-IR795 nanocomposites were significantly enhanced up to 51.7 and 6.3 folds compared with free IR795, owing to the localized surface plasmon resonance band of AuNRs overlapping with the absorption or fluorescence emission band of the IR795 dye. Under NIR laser irradiation, the cancer cell inhibition efficiency in vitro with synergetic PDT/PTT was up to 82.3%, compared with 10.3% for free IR795. Moreover, the enhanced fluorescence intensity of our designed nanocomposites was helpful to track their behavior in tumor cells. Therefore, our designed nanoagents highlight the applications of multimodal diagnostics and therapy in tumors based on MEF.",,,"Alkynes, Cell Line, Tumor, Endocytosis, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Gold, Humans, Hyperthermia, Induced, Nanotubes, Photochemotherapy, Phototherapy, Silicon Dioxide",,

The in organello reaction of dyes Cy3 and Cy5 led to a product that was easily traceable by Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). As determined by confocal laser scanning microscopy, the Cy3-Cy5 conjugate showed enhanced retention in mitochondria, relative to that of the starting compounds.

The aptamer binds to each dye with submicromolar K<sub>D</sub> values, and the resulting fluoromodules exhibit fluorescence quantum yields ranging from 0.17 to 0.51 and excellent photostability. The aptamer was fused to a second aptamer previously selected for binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to create a bifunctional aptamer that labels cell-surface EGFR on mammalian cells. The fluorescent color of the aptamer-labeled EGFR can be switched between blue and red in situ simply by exchanging the dye in the medium. The promiscuity of the aptamer can also be used to distinguish between cell-surface and internalized EGFR on the basis of the addition of red or blue fluorogen at different times.",,,"Aptamers, Nucleotide, Carbocyanines, ErbB Receptors, Fluorescent Dyes, Microscopy, Confocal, Molecular Structure, Phantoms, Imaging, RNA",,

The synthesized compounds, designed in the visible spectral range, are equipped with two different reactive groups for highly selective conjugation under physiological conditions. By applying indolenine precursors with functionalized benzenes, we achieved water-soluble asymmetric cyanine dyes bearing maleimido and <i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimidyl functionalities in a three-step synthesis. Spectroscopic characterization revealed good molar absorption coefficients and moderate fluorescence quantum yields. Further reaction with polyethylene glycol yielded dye-polymer conjugates that were subsequently coupled to the antibody cetuximab, often applied in cancer therapy. Successful coupling was confirmed by mass shifts detected by gel electrophoresis. Receptor-binding studies and live-cell imaging revealed that labeling did not alter the biological function. In sum, we provided a successful synthetic pathway to rigid heterobifunctional cyanine dyes that are applicable as fluorescent linkers, for example, for connecting antibodies with macromolecules. Our approach contributes to the field of bioconjugation chemistry, such as antibody-drug conjugates by combining diagnostic and therapeutic approaches.",,,,,

Time-dependent Kohn-Sham theory (TDKST) calculations were compared with coupled-cluster (CC) and equations-of-motion (EOM) CC results for π-to-π* singlet and triplet excitations. The RDs exhibit characteristics in the TDKST calculations that are very similar to previously investigated cyanine dyes, in the sense that the singlet energies obtained with nonhybrid functionals are too high compared with the CC results at the SD(T) level. The errors became increasingly larger for functionals with increasing amounts of exact exchange. TDKST with all tested functionals led to severe underestimations of the corresponding triplet excitations and overestimations of the singlet-triplet gaps. Long-range-corrected range-separated exchange and ""optimal tuning"" of the range separation parameter did not significantly improve the TDKST results. A detailed analysis suggests that the problem is differential electron correlation between the ground and excited states, which is not treated sufficiently by the relatively small integrals over the exchange-correlation response kernel that enter the excitation energy expression. Numerical criteria are suggested that may help identify ""cyanine-like"" problems in TDKST calculations of excitation spectra.",,,,,
28635650,The Application of Heptamethine Cyanine Dye DZ-1 and Indocyanine Green for Imaging and Targeting in Xenograft Models of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Near infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging has strong potential for widespread use in noninvasive tumor imaging. Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved NIRF dye for clinical diagnosis; however, it is unstable and poorly targets tumors. DZ-1 is a novel heptamethine cyanine NIRF dye, suitable for imaging and tumor targeting. Here, we compared the fluorescence intensity and metabolism of DZ-1 and ICG. Additionally, we assayed their specificities and abilities to target tumor cells, using cultured hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, a nude mouse subcutaneous xenograft model of liver cancer, and a rabbit orthotopic transplantation model. We found that DZ-1 accumulates in tumor tissue and specifically recognizes HCC in subcutaneous and orthotopic models. The NIRF intensity of DZ-1 was one order of magnitude stronger than that of ICG, and DZ-1 showed excellent intraoperative tumor targeting in the rabbit model. Importantly, ICG accumulated at tumor sites, as well as in the liver and kidney. Furthermore, DZ-1 analog-gemcitabine conjugate (NIRG) exhibited similar tumor-specific targeting and imaging properties, including inhibition of tumor growth, in HCC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice. DZ-1 and NIRG demonstrated superior tumor-targeting specificity, compared to ICG.

We hereby present direct evidence of non-radiative energy transfer well beyond the Förster limit for spatially separated donor and acceptor cyanine dyes strongly coupled to a cavity. The transient dynamics and the static spectra show an energy transfer efficiency approaching 37 % for donor-acceptor distances ≥100 nm. In such systems, the energy transfer process becomes independent of distance as long as the coupling strength is maintained.

This unique feature of NIRF dye makes it a promising candidate for imaging, targeted therapy and also as a drug delivery vehicle for various types of cancers. The favored uptake of dyes only in cancer cells is facilitated by several factors which include organic anion-transporting polypeptides, high mitochondrial membrane potential and tumor hypoxia in cancer cells. Currently nanotechnology has opened possibilities for multimodal or multifunctional strategies for cancer treatment. Including heptamethine cyanine dyes in nanoparticle based delivery systems have generally improved its theranostic ability by several fold owing to the multiple functionalities and structural features of heptamethine dyes. For this reason, nanocomplexes with NIRF heptamethine cyanine dye probe are preferred over non-targeting dyes such as indo cyanine green (ICG).

In vitro toxicity, in Caco-2 and HepG2 cells, indicated that dark toxicity was absent for concentrations up to 5µM (for the less active dye) or up to 1µM (for the two more active dyes). The three dyes present potential as photosensitizers, differing in irradiation conditions and period of incubation in the presence of irradiated dye. The less active dye needs a longer irradiation period to exhibit phototoxicity which is only evident after longer period of contact with cells (24h).

28524652,Optical Characteristics and Tumor Imaging Capabilities of Near Infrared Dyes in Free and Nano-Encapsulated Formulations Comprised of Viral Capsids.,"Near infrared (NIR) fluorescent molecules and nanosized structures can serve as potential optical probes for image-guided removal of small tumor nodules (≲ 1 mm diameter). Although indocyanine green (ICG) remains as the only FDA-approved NIR dye, other organic dyes are under extensive development for enhanced imaging capabilities. One such dye is BrCy106-NHS where bromine is substituted for aromatic structures in cyanine dyes. Herein, we investigate the absorption and fluorescence characteristics of ICG and BrCy106-NHS, and quantitatively assess their tumor imaging capabilities in free (non-encapsulated) and a nano-encapsulated form that utilizes the capsid protein (CP) from genome-depleted plant-infecting brome mosaic virus as the encapsulating shell. We refer to these nanoconstructs as optical viral ghosts (OVGs). For example, when fabricated at CP to dye concentration ratio of 200, value of the spectrally integrated fluorescence emission for BrCy106-NHS-doped OVGs is ∼60 times higher than that of ICG-doped OVGs. Our analysis of homogenized mice intraperitoneal tumors indicate that the averaged total fluorescence emission associated with the use of BrCy106-NHS-doped can be at least about 44 times greater than that of ICG-doped OVGs. Our results suggest that OVGs containing BrCy106-NHS may potentially serve as effective optical probes for tumor imaging.",,,"Animals, Capsid, Coloring Agents, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Indocyanine Green, Mice, Nanostructures, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging",,
28518192,Time-resolved signatures across the intramolecular response in substituted cyanine dyes.,"The optically populated excited state wave packet propagates along multidimensional intramolecular coordinates soon after photoexcitation. This action occurs alongside an intermolecular response from the surrounding solvent. Disentangling the multidimensional convoluted signal enables the possibility to separate and understand the initial intramolecular relaxation pathways over the excited state potential energy surface. Here we track the initial excited state dynamics by measuring the fluorescence yield from the first excited state as a function of time delay between two color femtosecond pulses for several cyanine dyes having different substituents. We find that when the high frequency pulse precedes the low frequency one and for timescales up to 200 fs, the excited state population can be depleted through stimulated emission with efficiency that is dependent on the molecular electronic structure. A similar observation at even shorter times was made by scanning the chirp (frequencies ordering) of a femtosecond pulse. The changes in depletion reflect the rate at which the nuclear coordinates of the excited state leave the Franck-Condon (FC) region and progress towards achieving equilibrium. Through functional group substitution, we explore these dynamic changes as a function of dipolar change following photoexcitation. Density functional theory calculations were performed to provide greater insight into the experimental spectroscopic observations. Complete active space (CAS) self-consistent field and CAS second order perturbation theory calculated potential energy surfaces tracking twisting and pyramidalization confirm that the steeper potential at the FC region leads to the observation of faster wave packet dynamics.",,,,,

Schiff base group was introduced to the molecular scaffold of Cy7, and promoted the aggregation of cyanine in pH7.4 buffer due to the strong π-π interaction. While in an acidic (pH 5.8) environment, the Schiff base group was hydrolyzed by acid and the nanoparticles were disaggregated. The vanishing of the intermolecular aggregation-caused quenching thus induced a fluorescence recovery of 96 folds. Moreover, abundant kinds of Schiff base provide more potential cyanine dyes for pH-responsive ultrahigh NIR fluorescence ""Off/On"" ratio, which could work as the intelligent bio-imaging probes in near future.",,,,,

In aqueous solution these probes possess three absorption bands corresponding to the monomer, dimer and H-aggregate species. The association of the dye with fibrillar lysozyme was followed by the enhancement of the monomer band and the reduction of the H-band. The absorption spectra measured at various fibril concentrations were analyzed in terms of the model allowing for the shift of equilibria between various dye species due to the binding of monomers and dimers of AK7-5 and AK7-6 to amyloid fibrils. The association constants and stoichiometries of the dye-fibril complexation have been evaluated. In contrast to fibrillar lysozyme, the native protein brought about strong J-aggregate formation accompanied by a marked drop in the absorbance of the dye monomer species. Quantum chemical calculations and simple docking studies showed that AK7-5 and AK7-6 monomers can bind to the grooves, running parallel to the fibril axis. Due to their ability to distinguish between the native and fibrillar protein states, the novel cyanines are recommended as complementary to existing amyloid markers.",,,"Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Models, Molecular, Molecular Docking Simulation, Muramidase, Protein Aggregates, Quantum Theory, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
28339120,Accessing Structurally Diverse Near-Infrared Cyanine Dyes for Folate Receptor-Targeted Cancer Cell Staining.,"Folate receptor (FR) targeting is one of the most promising strategies for the development of small-molecule-based cancer imaging agents considering that the FR is highly overexpressed on the surface of many cancer cell types. FR-targeted conjugates of near-infrared (NIR) emissive cyanine dyes are in advanced clinical trials for fluorescence-guided surgery and are valuable research tools for optical molecular imaging in animal models. Only a small number of promising conjugates has been evaluated so far. Analysis of structure-performance relations to identify critical factors modulating the performance of targeted conjugates is essential for successful further optimization. This contribution addresses the need for convenient synthetic access to structurally diverse NIR-emissive cyanine dyes for conjugation with folic acid. Structural variations were introduced to readily available cyanine precursors in particular via C-C-coupling reactions including Suzuki and (for the first time with these types of dyes) Sonogashira cross-couplings. Photophysical properties such as absorbance maxima, brightness, and photostability are highly dependent on the molecular structure. Selected modified cyanines were conjugated to folic acid for cancer cell targeting. Several conjugates display a favorable combination of high fluorescence brightness and photostability with high affinity to FR-positive cancer cells, and enable the selective imaging of these cells with low background.",,,"Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Fluorescent Dyes, Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored, HeLa Cells, Humans, Light, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",,

28066545,Predicting signatures of anisotropic resonance energy transfer in dye-functionalized nanoparticles.,"Resonance energy transfer (RET) is an inherently anisotropic process. Even the simplest, well-known Förster theory, based on the transition dipole-dipole coupling, implicitly incorporates the anisotropic character of RET. In this theoretical work, we study possible signatures of the fundamental anisotropic character of RET in hybrid nanomaterials composed of a semiconductor nanoparticle (NP) decorated with molecular dyes. In particular, by means of a realistic kinetic model, we show that the analysis of the dye photoluminescence difference for orthogonal input polarizations reveals the anisotropic character of the dye-NP RET which arises from the intrinsic anisotropy of the NP lattice. In a prototypical core/shell wurtzite CdSe/ZnS NP functionalized with cyanine dyes (Cy3B), this difference is predicted to be as large as 75% and it is strongly dependent in amplitude and sign on the dye-NP distance. We account for all the possible RET processes within the system, together with competing decay pathways in the separate segments. In addition, we show that the anisotropic signature of RET is persistent up to a large number of dyes per NP.",,,,,
27977203,Color in Bridge-Substituted Cyanines.,"Theories of color in cyanine dyes have evolved around the idea of a ""resonance"" of structures with distinct bonding and charge localization. Understanding the emergence of resonance models from the underlying many-electron problem remains a central issue for these systems. Here, the issue is addressed using a maximum-entropy approach to valence-bond representations of state-averaged complete-active space self-consistent field models. The approach allows calculation of energies and couplings of high-energy valence-bond structures that mediate superexchange couplings and chemical bonding. A series of valence-bond Hamiltonians for a series of bridge-substituted derivatives of Michler's hydrol blue (a monomethine cyanine) is presented. The Hamiltonians are approximated with a simple linear model parametrized by the Brown-Okamoto σ<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup> parameter of the bridge substituent. A quantitative lower bound on σ<sub>p</sub><sup>+</sup>, beyond which a resonant cyanine-like ground state will not exist, is presented. The large effective coupling in two-state resonance models emerges from superexchange associated with either covalent bonding or charge-carrier delocalization, with the former contribution significantly the stronger. The results provide ab initio justification for empirical diabatic-state models of methine optical response. They are of general interest for understanding the optoelectronic response in cyanines.",,,,,

27938668,Cellular encoding of Cy dyes for single-molecule imaging.,"A general method is described for the site-specific genetic encoding of cyanine dyes as non-canonical amino acids (Cy-ncAAs) into proteins. The approach relies on an improved technique for nonsense suppression with in vitro misacylated orthogonal tRNA. The data show that Cy-ncAAs (based on Cy3 and Cy5) are tolerated by the eukaryotic ribosome in cell-free and whole-cell environments and can be incorporated into soluble and membrane proteins. In the context of the <i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocyte expression system, this technique yields ion channels with encoded Cy-ncAAs that are trafficked to the plasma membrane where they display robust function and distinct fluorescent signals as detected by TIRF microscopy. This is the first demonstration of an encoded cyanine dye as a ncAA in a eukaryotic expression system and opens the door for the analysis of proteins with single-molecule resolution in a cellular environment.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Gene Expression, Luminescent Proteins, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Recombinant Proteins, Single Molecule Imaging, Xenopus laevis",,
27934475,Proximity-Induced H-Aggregation of Cyanine Dyes on DNA-Duplexes.,"A wide variety of organic dyes form, under certain conditions, clusters know as J- and H-aggregates. Cyanine dyes are such a class of molecules where the spatial proximity of several dyes leads to overlapping electron orbitals and thus to the creation of a new energy landscape compared to that of the individual units. In this work, we create artificial H-aggregates of exactly two Cyanine 3 (Cy3) dyes by covalently linking them to a DNA molecule with controlled subnanometer distances. The absorption spectra of these coupled systems exhibit a blue-shifted peak, whose intensity varies depending on the distance between the dyes and the rigidity of the DNA template. Simulated vibrational resolved spectra, based on molecular orbital theory, excellently reproduce the experimentally observed features. Circular dichroism spectroscopy additionally reveals distinct signals, which indicates a chiral arrangement of the dye molecules.

To determine the relative capability of the different dye species to inject photoexcited electrons into a wideband gap oxide semiconductor, sensitization at a single-crystal zinc oxide surface was studied by simultaneous attenuated reflection (ATR) ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption and photocurrent spectroscopy measurements. ATR measurements enable identification of the dye species populating the surface with simultaneous photocurrent spectroscopy to identify the contribution of the various dye forms to photocurrent signal. We study the dye 2,2'-carboxymethylthiodicarbocyanine bromide that is particularly prone to aggregation both in solution and at the surface of sensitized oxide semiconductors.",,,,,
30023492,Responsive Contrast Agents: Synthesis and Characterization of a Tunable Series of pH-Sensitive Near-Infrared Pentamethines.,"The demand for responsive dyes in optical imaging is high to achieve a better signal-to-noise ratio and, more specifically, to visualize acidic compartments of the endocytic pathway. Herein, we present a new synthetic route, with a step-by-step synthesis of water-soluble pH-sensitive cyanine dyes exhibiting p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values in the region of physiological pH, as confirmed by absorption and fluorescence spectra. Moreover, modification of p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values was achieved by two different substitution patterns, creating tunable pH-sensitive dyes. We demonstrated the functionality of the pH-sensitive dyes and their suitability as contrast agents for cellular uptake studies by preparing dye-labeled cetuximab and transferrin conjugates. Sulfonated head chains increased water solubility and prevented the formation of dimers, even in the context of dye-labeled bioconjugates. Confocal microscopy images of living cells revealed their pH-responsiveness, as specific fluorescence signal enhancements were observed in acidic compartments of the endocytic pathway (endosomes and lysosomes), although the background signal was low in a pH-neutral environment. Using mixtures of conjugates labeled with either a pH-sensitive or non-pH-sensitive dye for the uptake studies, we could follow the receptor binding and distinguish it from the endocytic uptake process of the conjugates in a simultaneous manner. Moreover, we used flow cytometry to quantify the fluorescence and observed a 3-fold signal enhancement for the pH-sensitive dye conjugates over a period of 3 h.",,,,,

To achieve water solubility and enhance tumor delivery, the hydrophobic IR775 dye was loaded into a biocompatible polymeric nanoparticle with a diameter of ~40nm and slightly negative surface charge (-2.34mV). The nanoparticle-encapsulated hydrophobic IR775 dye (IR775-NP) is characterized by an enhanced fluorescence quantum yield (16%) when compared to the water soluble analogs such as ICG (2.7%) and IR783 (8%). Furthermore, the developed IR-775-NP efficiently generates both heat and reactive oxygen species under NIR light irradiation, eradicating cancer cells in vitro. Finally, animal studies revealed that the IR775-NP accumulates in cancer tumors after systemic administration, efficiently delineates them with NIR fluorescence signal and completely eradicates chemo resistant cancer tissue after a single dose of combinatorial phototherapy.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indoles, Mice, Nanoparticles, Optical Imaging, Ovarian Neoplasms, Ovary, Phototherapy, Theranostic Nanomedicine",,

Herein, we synthesized a series of unsymmetrical cyanine dyes and evaluated their fluorescence properties. A systematic structure-property relationship study has revealed that the dialkylamino group at the 2-position of quinoline in a series of unsymmetrical cyanine dyes plays a critical role in the fluorescence enhancement. Four newly designed unsymmetrical cyanine dyes showed negligible intrinsic fluorescence in the free state and strong fluorescence upon binding to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) with a quantum yield of 0.53 to 0.90, which is 2 to 3 times higher than previous unsymmetrical cyanine dyes. A detailed analysis of the fluorescence lifetime revealed that the dialkylamino group at the 2-position of quinoline suppressed nonradiative decay in favor of increased fluorescence quantum yield. Moreover, these newly developed dyes were able to stain the nucleus specifically in fixed HeLa cells examined by using a confocal laser-scanning microscope.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA Probes, Fluorescent Dyes, HeLa Cells, Humans, Limit of Detection, Microscopy, Confocal, Molecular Structure, Phantoms, Imaging, Quinolines",,

33440529,Cyanine-Curcumin Assembling Nanoparticles for Near-Infrared Imaging and Photothermal Therapy.,"Near-infrared (NIR) imaging and photothermal therapy (PTT) based on the multifunctional cyanine dyes has shown great promise for cancer therapy. However, most of the PTT agents are often limited by low drug loading, short circulation time, and low biocompatibility. Herein, we developed cyanine-curcumin assembling nanoparticles (CCNPs) via a single-step reprecipitation method. IR-780-C4 (Cyc4) was employed as a photothermal and NIR imaging agent. Self-assembly of Cyc4 and curcumin in aqueous solution could be performed in the absence of surfactants or adjuvants, which is a simple and efficient way to fabricate nanomedicine with high drug loading. Formed CCNPs showed monodispersity, good stability in physiological conditions, and lower cytotoxicity. Moreover, CCNPs possess the high loading (70%) of cyanine dyes and a higher photothermal conversion efficacy than free Cyc4, which contribute to a decrease in the application dosage of cyanine dyes in cancer therapy. Importantly, CCNPs exhibited excellent NIR imaging capacity and photothermal tumor ablation under laser irradiation in vitro and in vivo. This work highlights the potential of using self-assembling of drug molecules to develop functional nanoparticles for drug delivery and cancer therapy.",,,,,
27277828,Pre-clinical Evaluation of a Cyanine-Based SPECT Probe for Multimodal Tumor Necrosis Imaging.,"Recently we showed that a number of carboxylated near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) cyanine dyes possess strong necrosis avid properties in vitro as well as in different mouse models of spontaneous and therapy-induced tumor necrosis, indicating their potential use for cancer diagnostic- and prognostic purposes. In the previous study, the detection of the cyanines was achieved by whole body optical imaging, a technique that, due to the limited penetration of near-infrared light, is not suitable for investigations deeper than 1 cm within the human body. Therefore, in order to facilitate clinical translation, the purpose of the present study was to generate a necrosis avid cyanine-based NIRF probe that could also be used for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). For this, the necrosis avid NIRF cyanine HQ4 was radiolabeled with <sup>111</sup>indium, via the chelate diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA). The necrosis avid properties of the radiotracer [<sup>111</sup>In]DTPA-HQ4 were examined in vitro and in vivo in different breast tumor models in mice using SPECT and optical imaging. Moreover, biodistribution studies were performed to examine the pharmacokinetics of the probe in vivo. Using optical imaging and radioactivity measurements, in vitro, we showed selective accumulation of [<sup>111</sup>In]DTPA-HQ4 in dead cells. Using SPECT and in biodistribution studies, the necrosis avidity of the radiotracer was confirmed in a 4T1 mouse breast cancer model of spontaneous tumor necrosis and in a MCF-7 human breast cancer model of chemotherapy-induced tumor necrosis. The radiotracer [<sup>111</sup>In]DTPA-HQ4 possessed strong and selective necrosis avidity in vitro and in various mouse models of tumor necrosis in vivo, indicating its potential to be clinically applied for diagnostic purposes and to monitor anti-cancer treatment efficacy.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Disease Models, Animal, Female, Humans, Indium Radioisotopes, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Multimodal Imaging, Necrosis, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Pentetic Acid, Tissue Distribution, Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",,

In this article, we systematically investigate the optical properties of nanoparticle-tipped silicon nanowires (NPTWs) and characterize their ability to enhance the fluorescence signal of two cyanine dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) selectively bound to the gold tip. Although both gold and silicon components contribute to the fluorescence signal enhancement, the experimentally observed strong morphology dependence of the fluorescence emission enhancement is demonstrated to depend on tunable leaky modes of the silicon nanowires. The ability to encode emission fluorescence enhancement in the structure of NPTWs is of high relevance for multiparametric biosensing and imaging.",,,,,
27790811,Influence of Label and Charge Density on the Association of the Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Trastuzumab and Cetuximab Conjugated to Anionic Fluorophores.,"The design of bright and functional dye-protein conjugates requires hydrophilic and stable fluorophores with high molar absorption coefficients and high fluorescence quantum yields, which must not be prone to dimerization, as well as conservation of protein function and suppression of protein association. Although many synthetic dyes meet these needs, the influence of dye charge on bioconjugate performance is commonly neglected. This encouraged us to assess the spectroscopic properties, antibody functionality, binding behavior, folding, and association of conjugates of the therapeutic antibodies trastuzumab and cetuximab with the red cyanine dyes S0586, S2381, and 6SIDCC (bearing two, three, and six sulfonate groups, respectively). Our results demonstrate a negligible effect of dye labeling on antibody folding, yet a strong influence of label charge and density on antibody isoelectric points and association. Especially 6SIDCC decreased strongly the isoelectric points of both antibodies and their heavy or light chains even at low labeling degrees, thus favoring protein association. Although an increasingly negative dye charge reduces antigen affinity as shown in a competitive immunoassay, all conjugates still bound to cells overexpressing the target of the respective antibody. Obviously, dyes that cause minimum dimerization with a small number of charged groups are best for conjugate brightness, minimum protein association, and strong target binding. This underlines the need to consider dye charge for the rational design of conjugates with optimum performance.",,,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, Antigen-Antibody Reactions, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cetuximab, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Circular Dichroism, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Isoelectric Point, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Protein Folding, Spectrophotometry, Trastuzumab",,
27783069,An atomistic view on carbocyanine photophysics in the realm of RNA.,"Carbocyanine dyes have a long-standing tradition in fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy, due to their photostability and large spectral separation between individual dye species. Herein, we explore the versatility of cyanine dyes to probe the dynamics of nucleic acids and we report on the interrelation of fluorophores, RNA, and metal ions, namely K<sup>+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. Photophysical parameters including the fluorescence lifetime, quantum yield and dynamic anisotropy are monitored as a function of the nucleic acid composition, conformation, and metal ion abundance. Occasional excursions to a non-fluorescent cis-state hint at the remarkable sensitivity of carbocyanines to their local environment. Comparison of time-correlated single photon experiments with all-atom molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the propensity of photoisomerization is dictated by sterical constraints imposed on the fluorophore. Structural features in the vicinity of the dye play a crucial role in RNA recognition and have far-reaching implications on the mobility of the fluorescent probe. An atomic level description of the mutual interactions will ultimately benefit the quantitative interpretation of single-molecule FRET measurements on large RNA systems.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Magnesium, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, Monte Carlo Method, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Potassium, RNA",,
27628907,Radical Reactions Induced by Visible Light in Dichloromethane Solutions of Hünig's Base: Synthetic Applications and Mechanistic Observations.,"β-(3-Iodopropoxy)-substituted α,β-unsaturated lactams, lactones, and cycloalkenones (eight examples) underwent reductive radical reactions in a dichloromethane solution of N,N-diisopropylethylamine (Hünig's base) upon irradiation with visible light (λ=419 nm). Apart from plain reduction reactions (hydro-de-iodination), a significant degree of cyclization was observed in three cases. In parallel to the conversion of the substrates, the formation of intensely colored by-products was observed. Based on mass spectrometric evidence and upon comparison with known compounds, the by-products were identified as cyanine dyes. Their formation supports the hypothesis that irradiation of dichloromethane solutions of Hünig's base leads to the formation of radicals, which in turn can either initiate a radical reaction or combine with cyanine precursors. It was shown by deuterium-labelling experiments, that one equivalent of dichloromethane is incorporated into the cyanine dyes and that the reductive quenching of radical intermediates is at least partially due to hydrogen abstraction from the solvent. As a consequence, a reductive cyclization of the starting materials is favored in CD<sub>2</sub> Cl<sub>2</sub> solutions as shown for two β-(3-iodopropoxy)-substituted tetronates, which underwent in dichloromethane almost exclusive reduction, but gave predominantly the cyclization products in CD<sub>2</sub> Cl<sub>2</sub> .",,,,,
27564088,Synthesis and in Vitro and in Vivo Evaluation of MMP-12 Selective Optical Probes.,"In designing new tracers consisting of a small peptide conjugated to a reporter of comparable size, particular attention needs to be paid to the selection of the reporter group, which can dictate both the in vitro and the in vivo performances of the whole conjugate. In the case of fluorescent tracers, this is particularly true given the large numbers of available dye moieties differing in their structures and properties. Here, we have investigated the in vitro and in vivo properties of a novel series of MMP-12 selective probes composed of cyanine dyes varying in their structure, net charge, and hydrophilic character, tethered through a linker to a potent and specific MMP-12 phosphinic pseudopeptide inhibitor. The impact of linker length has been also explored. The crystallographic structure of one tracer in complex with MMP-12 has been obtained, providing the first crystal structure of a Cy5.5-derived probe and confirming that the binding of the targeting moiety is unaffected. MMP-12 remains the tracers' privileged target, as attested by their affinity selectivity profile evaluated in solution toward a panel of 12 metalloproteases. In vivo assessment of four selected probes has highlighted not only the impact of the dye structure but also that of the linker length on the probes' blood clearance rates and their biodistributions. These experiments have also provided valuable data on the stability of the dye moieties in vivo. This has permitted the identification of one probe, which combines favorable binding to MMP-12 in solution and on cells with optimized in vivo performance including blood clearance rate suitable for short-time imaging. Through this series of tracers, we have identified various critical factors modulating the tracers' in vivo behavior, which is both useful for the development and optimization of MMP-12 selective radiolabeled tracers and informative for the design of fluorescent probes in general.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Chemistry Techniques, Synthetic, Crystallography, X-Ray, HeLa Cells, Humans, Matrix Metalloproteinase 12, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Molecular Imaging, Molecular Probes, Optics and Photonics, Peptides, Tissue Distribution",,

Fitting to a one-dimensional diffusion model, we find an average exciton diffusion constant of 55 ± 20 cm<sup>2</sup>/s, among the highest measured for an organic system. We develop a simple model that uses cryogenic measurements of static and dynamic energetic disorder to estimate a diffusion constant of 32 cm<sup>2</sup>/s, in agreement with experiment. We ascribe large exciton diffusion lengths to low static and dynamic energetic disorder in LHNs. We argue that matrix-stabilized LHNS represent an excellent model system to study coherent excitonic transport.",,,,,
27605432,Near-Infrared Fluorescent Probe with High Quantum Yield and Its Application in the Selective Detection of Glutathione in Living Cells and Tissues.,"Glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), and homocysteine (Hcy) are small-molecular biothiols that play key roles in various biological systems. Among these biothiols, GSH is the most abundant intracellular thiol. Until now, a small number of the near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes have been designed for the detection of GSH. Unfortunately, most of these NIR probes are based on cyanine dyes, which generally suffer low fluorescence quantum yield (Φ < 0.25), which are not suitable for bioimaging. In addition, some probes are difficult to effectively distinguish GSH from Cys and Hcy. In this work, an NIR fluorescent probe with high fluorescence quantum yield is developed by introducing a rigid coplanar structure such as rhodamine dyes, and the NIR probe (CyR) with spirolactam structure is first synthesized and used to recognize GSH. The characteristics of this NIR probe are as follows: (1) probe CyR exhibits high fluorescence quantum yield (Φ = 0.43) after the addition of GSH and high sensitivity toward GSH with 75-fold fluorescence enhancement. (2) The probe is highly selective, which will not interfere with the other biological thiols (Cys, Hcy) and amino acids. (3) A possible reaction mechanism of the NIR probe CyR and GSH (Cys, Hcy) can be proposed and proved by <sup>1</sup>H NMR, <sup>13</sup>C NMR, and MS (mass spectra).

Oligonucleotides are post-synthetically labeled by two new photostable cyanine dyes using copper-catalyzed click-chemistry. The synthesis of both donor and acceptor dye is described and is performed in three consecutive steps. With the DNA as the surrounding architecture, these two dyes undergo an energy transfer when they are brought into close proximity by hybridization. Therefore, annealing of two single stranded DNA strands is visualized by a change of fluorescence color. This color change is characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy but can also be directly observed by using a handheld ultraviolet (UV) lamp. The concept of a dual fluorescence color readout makes these oligonucleotide probes excellent tools for molecular imaging especially when the described photostable dyes are used.

27452807,Effect of charge localization on the in vivo optical imaging properties of near-infrared cyanine dye/monoclonal antibody conjugates.,"Near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores show superior in vivo imaging properties than visible-light fluorophores because of the increased light penetration in tissue and lower autofluorescence of these wavelengths. We have recently reported that new NIR cyanine dyes containing a novel C4'-O-alkyl linker exhibit greater chemical stability and excellent optical properties relative to existing C4'-O-aryl variants. In this study, we synthesized two NIR cyanine dyes with the same core structure and charge but different indolenine substituents: FNIR-Z-759 bearing a combination of two sulfonates and two quaternary ammonium cations, and FNIR-G-765 bearing a combination of two sulfonates and two guanidines, resulting in zwitterionic charge with distinct cationic moieties. In this study, we compare the in vitro and in vivo optical imaging properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugates of FNIR-Z-759 and FNIR-G-765 with panitumumab (pan) at antibody-to-dye ratios of 1 : 2 or 1 : 5. One-to-five conjugation of pan-to-FNIR-G-765 was not successful due to aggregate formation during the conjugation reaction. Conjugates of both dyes to pan (2 : 1) demonstrated similar quenching capacity, stability, and brightness in target cells in vitro. However, FNIR-Z-759 conjugates showed significantly lower accumulation in the mouse liver, resulting in higher tumor-to-liver ratio. Thus, FNIR-Z-759 conjugates appear to have superior in vivo imaging characteristics compared with FNIR-G-765 conjugates, especially in the abdominal region. Moreover, from a chemistry point of view, mAb conjugation with FNIR-Z-759 has an advantage over FNIR-G-765, because it does not form aggregates at high dye-to-mAb ratio. These results suggest that zwitterionic cyanine dyes are a superior class of fluorophores for conjugating with mAbs for fluorescence imaging applications due to improving target-to-background contrast in vivo. However, zwitterionic cyanine dyes should be designed carefully, as small changes to the structure can alter in vivo pharmacokinetics of mAb-dye conjugates.",,,"Animals, Antibodies, Monoclonal, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Female, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Immunoconjugates, Mice, Mice, Nude, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Molecular Structure, Optical Imaging, Panitumumab, Signal-To-Noise Ratio, Tissue Distribution",,

The impact of resin viscosity on photopolymerization reactions was measured and related to the overall radical quantum yields. The quantum yields were calculated according to the photocyclic behaviour of the initiating systems based on the Astrazon orange dyes. These dyes are characterized by a viscosity dependent photophysics, which leads to an isomerization-diffusion-controlled photopolymerization. Besides this demonstration, Astrazon orange dyes appeared to be very good candidates for free radical photopolymerization in the visible, presenting high absorption coefficient, low cost and good sensitivity.",,,,,
27355235,Convenient Preparation and Detailed Analysis of a Series of NHC-Stabilized Phosphorus(I) Dyes and Their Derivatives.,"A safe, convenient, and P-atom-efficient synthesis of N-heterocyclic-carbene- (NHC-) stabilized phosphorus(I) bromide salts is reported that involves P(+) transfer from an easily prepared triphosphenium precursor. The resulting family of phosphamethine cyanine dyes featuring N,N'-dialkyl-substituted 4,5-dimethylimidazole-2-ylidenes ((R)NHC(Me)) and benzimidazole-2-ylidenes ((R)NHC(B)) (R = Me, Et, iPr) have been fully characterized. We found that increasing N-alkyl group size causes increased twisting of the carbene fragments from the C-P-C plane, which decreases the magnitude of hyperconjugation between the π-type lone pair on phosphorus and the carbene fragments. This decrease is manifested as changes in the (31)P NMR chemical shifts, magnitudes of the P-C coupling constants, and electronic spectra of the cations. The reactivities of these ions toward various oxidants are reported: Oxidation by sulfur generates dithiophosphinium salts, protonation or methylation gives dicationic phosphines, and coordination to 1 or 2 equiv of gold(I) chloride results in mono or bimetallic complexes, respectively.",,,,,

In particular, one prepared heptamethine cyanine dye, bearing a tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate as a counter anion and an N-ethyl-2,2,2-trifluoroacetamido group at the meso position, showed not only a high decomposition temperature (Tdt ), but also very high photostability toward white LED irradiation.",,,,,
27267787,Synthesis and Characterization of Water-Soluble Conjugated Oligoelectrolytes for Near-Infrared Fluorescence Biological Imaging.,"Near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores attract increasing attention as a molecular marker (or probe) for in vivo and in vitro biological fluorescence imaging. Three types of new NIR fluorescent conjugated oligoelectrolytes (COEs: Q-FlTBTTFl, Q-FlBBTFl, and Q-FlTBBTTFl) are synthesized with quaternized ammonium ionic groups in their side-chains for water solubility. The emission wavelength is modulated in the range 600-1300 nm, by adjusting the intramolecular charge transfer in the molecular backbone based on the electron-rich fluorene (and/or thiophene) and electron-deficient benzo[2,1,3]thiadiazole (or benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c']bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole) moieties. The COEs show a remarkably larger Stokes shift (147-276 nm) compared to commercial rhodamine and cyanine dyes in water, avoiding self-quenching and interference from the excitation backscattered light. The photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency is improved substantially by up to 27.8% in water by fabricating a vesicular complex, COE/v, with a block ionomer, poly[(ethylene oxide)-block-(sodium 2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonate)]. In vitro cellular uptake images with the COEs are obtained with good biocompatibility by confocal single-photon and two-photon microscopy. The ex vivo and in vivo images of a mouse xenograft model treated with the Q-FlBBTFl/v exhibit a substantially stronger fluorescence signal at the tumor site than at the other organs, highlighting the potential of the COE/v as an NIR fluorescent imaging agent for the diagnosis of cancer.",,,"Animals, Electrolytes, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Water",,

Positively charged cyanines interact with QDs surface which is negatively charged due to capping agent carboxylate ions. The energy transfer parameters including Stern-Volmer constant, Ksv, number of binding sites, n, quenching sphere radius, r, the critical energy transfer distance, R0, and energy transfer efficiencies, E have been calculated. The effect of structure and the number of aggregating molecules have been studied as a function of CdTe QDs particle size. Combining organic and inorganic semiconductors leads to increase of the effective absorption cross section of the QDs which can be utilized in novel nanoscale designs for light-emitting, photovoltaic and sensor applications. A synthesized triplet emission of the studied dyes was observed using CdTe QDs as donors and this is expected to play a potential role in molecular oxygen sensitization and in photodynamic therapy (PDT) applications.",,,"Cadmium Compounds, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Energy Transfer, Particle Size, Quantum Dots, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Tellurium, Thermodynamics, Thioglycolates",,
27165449,"Review on near-infrared heptamethine cyanine dyes as theranostic agents for tumor imaging, targeting, and photodynamic therapy.","A class of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) heptamethine cyanine dyes that are taken up and accumulated specifically in cancer cells without chemical conjugation have recently emerged as promising tools for tumor imaging and targeting. In addition to their fluorescence and nuclear imaging-based tumor-imaging properties, these dyes can be developed as drug carriers to safely deliver chemotherapy drugs to tumors. They can also be used as effective agents for photodynamic therapy with remarkable tumoricidal activity via photodependent cytotoxic activity. The preferential uptake of dyes into cancer but not normal cells is co-operatively mediated by the prevailing activation of a group of organic anion-transporting polypeptides on cancer cell membranes, as well as tumor hypoxia and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in cancer cells. Such mechanistic explorations have greatly advanced the current application and future development of NIRF dyes and their derivatives as anticancer theranostic agents. This review summarizes current knowledge and emerging advances in NIRF dyes, including molecular characterization, photophysical properties, multimodal development and uptake mechanisms, and their growing potential for preclinical and clinical use.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Mice, Nude, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Theranostic Nanomedicine",,

It is an essential core scaffold present in many natural (Vitamin B1- Thiamine) and synthetic medicinally important compounds. The versatility of thiazole nucleus demonstrated by the fact that it is an essential part of penicillin nucleus and some of its derivatives which have shown antimicrobial (sulfazole), antiretroviral (ritonavir), antifungal (abafungin), antihistaminic and antithyroid activities. The synthetic importance of thiazole derivatives, its reduced forms and condensed derivatives have been increased much by their recent applications as anticancer (tiazofurin), anthelmintic, vulcanising accelerators (mercaptobenzothiazole) and photographic sensitizers. Thiazole chemistry has developed steadily after the pioneering work of Hofmann and Hantsch. Bogert and co-workers made significant contribution to expand this field. Mills established the importance of thiazole ring in cyanine dyes which is used as photographic sensitizer. Benzothiazole, a fused derivative of thiazole have also proved its commercial value.

27109352,Proteome analysis reveals translational inhibition of Caenorhabditis elegans enhances susceptibility to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 pathogenesis.,"Caenorhabditis elegans-Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection model is commonly used for pathogenesis studies over the decades. In the present study, upon exposure to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, the 2D-PAGE was performed to examine the total proteins differences of C. elegans during the PAO1 infection at different time durations (12-48h). Also, the 2D-DIGE using the cyanine dyes were performed (48h) to identify the differentially regulated proteins against the PAO1 infection. Among the 19 short-listed proteins, 5 proteins were down-regulated and 14 proteins were up-regulated. Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 (EEF-2), a GTP binding protein involves in protein elongation process was down regulated during the pathogen infection. The 2D-PAGE analysis and MS data for the 12 and 24h infections identified the NDK-1 and other essential protein includes, ACS-18, ACT-1, GPD-3, GDH-1 and LBP-6 which are involved in important cellular homeostasis were down regulated. Validation studies using qPCR analysis for eef-2 and other selected genes, western blot analysis for EEF-2 and effect of host translational inhibition studies using Cycloheximide during PAO1 infection suggests that P. aeruginosa systematically restrains the function of host by arresting the expression of EEF-2 and thereby inhibiting protein translational events. Further, in silico analysis revealed the Exotoxin A could directly bind with the host EEF-2 and NDK-1 during the C. elegans- PAO1 interactions. Model system, C. elegans facilitates the identification of virulence mechanisms during bacterial pathogenesis. Upon infection by the fungal and bacterial pathogens, the C. elegans system induces an array of transcriptional responses, including differential expression of effector/modulator genes that provide safeguard and fight against infection. However, the in-depth knowledge of host response by the pathogen at protein level remains unclear. Much of the studies were carried out only at the transcripts level and scarce reports are available at the protein level for the host-pathogen interaction studies. In order to provide few interesting clues at the protein level, the nematode, C. elegans was infected with the human pathogen P. aeruginosa and the response(s) of host was investigated at the protein level by 2D-DIGE analysis and further validation studies using qPCR and western blotting techniques. Our differential proteomics data suggest that translational inhibition as one of the patterns of pathogenesis in C. elegans during P. aeruginosa infection. Since many of the effectors identified through C. elegans are conserved in other systems including human, our data pave the way for understanding important regulatory pathways involved during bacterial pathogenesis that can be translated into higher eukaryotic organisms.",,,"ADP Ribose Transferases, Animals, Bacterial Toxins, Caenorhabditis elegans, Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins, Disease Susceptibility, Exotoxins, Gene Expression Regulation, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Nucleoside-Diphosphate Kinase, Peptide Elongation Factor 2, Protein Biosynthesis, Proteome, Proteomics, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Virulence Factors, Pseudomonas aeruginosa Exotoxin A",,
27087967,Using membrane composition to fine-tune the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of an optical liposome pH sensor.,"Liposomes containing membrane-anchored pH-sensitive optical probes are valuable sensors for monitoring pH in various biomedical samples. The dynamic range of the sensor is maximized when the probe p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> is close to the expected sample pH. While some biomedical samples are close to neutral pH there are several circumstances where the pH is 1 or 2 units lower. Thus, there is a need to fine-tune the probe p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> in a predictable way. This investigation examined two lipid-conjugated optical probes, each with appended deep-red cyanine dyes containing indoline nitrogen atoms that are protonated in acid. The presence of anionic phospholipids in the liposomes stabilized the protonated probes and increased the probe p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> values by < 1 unit. The results show that rational modification of the membrane composition is a general non-covalent way to fine-tune the p<i>K</i><sub>a</sub> of an optical liposome sensor for optimal pH sensing performance.",,,,,
27072296,Non-Radiative Energy Transfer Mediated by Hybrid Light-Matter States.,"We present direct evidence of enhanced non-radiative energy transfer between two J-aggregated cyanine dyes strongly coupled to the vacuum field of a cavity. Excitation spectroscopy and femtosecond pump-probe measurements show that the energy transfer is highly efficient when both the donor and acceptor form light-matter hybrid states with the vacuum field. The rate of energy transfer is increased by a factor of seven under those conditions as compared to the normal situation outside the cavity, with a corresponding effect on the energy transfer efficiency. The delocalized hybrid states connect the donor and acceptor molecules and clearly play the role of a bridge to enhance the rate of energy transfer. This finding has fundamental implications for coherent energy transport and light-energy harvesting.",,,,,
27038282,"Nucleation, growth, and dissolution of silver nanostructures formed in nanotubular J-aggregates of amphiphilic cyanine dyes.","Solution fabricated high aspect ratio silver nanowires are of interest because of their usability in plasmonic devices or transparent electrodes. Recently, silver nanowires with diameters of 6.5 nm and lengths exceeding tens or hundreds of microns were grown by reduction of silver ions within the inner volume of nanotubular J-aggregates of an amphiphilic cyanine dye. Unlike in other soft template systems, the anisotropic growth of the silver wires is not caused by different screening of the diverse facets of silver crystals. Instead, the shape of the wires replicates the inner space of the tubes without destroying the template. This effect is demonstrated by ex-situ observation of the growth of the silver wires via transmission electron microscopy. The wire growth is initiated by exposure to blue light and starts with small, isolated crystallites within the tubular aggregates. The crystallites grow into pieces of wires that finally coalesce into continuous wires. The growth is mediated by material transport through the membrane-like wall of the dye aggregates. This wall permeability is further demonstrated by dissolution of the silver wires via oxidative etching by addition of sodium chloride. It is concluded that the cyanine double layer wall is permeable for ions such as silver, sodium, chlorine, and water molecules. This permeability permits control of the wire length through the concentration of chlorine when oxygen is removed from the solvent.",,,,,
26998673,Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Characterization of DNA Wrapping in Closed and Open Escherichia coli RNA Polymerase-λP(R) Promoter Complexes.,"Initial recognition of promoter DNA by RNA polymerase (RNAP) is proposed to trigger a series of conformational changes beginning with bending and wrapping of the 40-50 bp of DNA immediately upstream of the -35 region. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the presence of upstream DNA facilitates bending and entry of the downstream duplex (to +20) into the active site cleft to form an advanced closed complex (CC), prior to melting of ∼13 bp (-11 to +2), including the transcription start site (+1). Atomic force microscopy and footprinting revealed that the stable open complex (OC) is also highly wrapped (-60 to +20). To test the proposed bent-wrapped model of duplex DNA in an advanced RNAP-λP(R) CC and compare wrapping in the CC and OC, we use fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between cyanine dyes at far-upstream (-100) and downstream (+14) positions of promoter DNA. Similarly large intrinsic FRET efficiencies are observed for the CC (0.30 ± 0.07) and the OC (0.32 ± 0.11) for both probe orientations. Fluorescence enhancements at +14 are observed in the single-dye-labeled CC and OC. These results demonstrate that upstream DNA is extensively wrapped and the start site region is bent into the cleft in the advanced CC, reducing the distance between positions -100 and +14 on promoter DNA from >300 to <100 Å. The proximity of upstream DNA to the downstream cleft in the advanced CC is consistent with the proposed mechanism for facilitation of OC formation by upstream DNA.",,,"Bacterial Proteins, Bacteriophage lambda, Catalytic Domain, DNA, Viral, DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases, Escherichia coli, Escherichia coli Proteins, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Holoenzymes, Kinetics, Models, Molecular, Molecular Conformation, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Protein Stability, Protein Subunits, Protein Unfolding, Recombinant Proteins, Structural Homology, Protein, Thermus thermophilus",,
26935762,Controlling S2 Population in Cyanine Dyes Using Shaped Femtosecond Pulses.,"Fast population transfer from higher to lower excited states occurs via internal conversion (IC) and is the basis of Kasha's rule, which states that spontaneous emission takes place from the lowest excited state of the same multiplicity. Photonic control over IC is of interest because it would allow direct influence over intramolecular nonradiative decay processes occurring in condensed phase. Here we tracked the S2 and S1 fluorescence yield for different cyanine dyes in solution as a function of linear chirp. For the cyanine dyes with polar solvation response IR144 and meso-piperidine substituted IR806, increased S2 emission was observed when using transform limited pulses, whereas chirped pulses led to increased S1 emission. The nonpolar solvated cyanine IR806, on the other hand, did not show S2 emission. A theoretical model, based on a nonperturbative solution of the equation of motion for the density matrix, is offered to explain and simulate the anomalous chirp dependence. Our findings, which depend on pulse properties beyond peak intensity, offer a photonic method to control S2 population thereby opening the door for the exploration of photochemical processes initiated from higher excited states.",,,,,
26927099,A Highly Selective Sensor for Cyanide in Organic Media and on Solid Surfaces.,"The application of IR 786 perchlorate (IR-786) as a selective optical sensor for cyanide anion in both organic solution (acetonitrile (MeCN), 100%) and solvent-free solid surfaces was demonstrated. In MeCN, IR-786 was selective to two anions in the following order: CN(-) > OH(-). A significant change in the characteristic dark green color of IR-786 in MeCN to yellow was observed as a result of nucleophilic addition of CN(-) to the fluorophore, i.e., formation of IR 786-(CN), which was also verified by a blue shift in the 775 nm absorbance peak to 430 nm. A distinct green fluorescence emission from the IR-786-(CN) in MeCN was also observed, which demonstrated the selectivity of IR-786 towards CN(-) in MeCN. Fluorescence emission studies of IR-786 showed that the lower detection limit and the sensitivity of IR-786 for CN(-) in MeCN was 0.5 μM and 0.5 to 8 μM, respectively. The potential use of IR-786 as a solvent-free solid state sensor for the selective sensing and monitoring of CN(-) in the environment was also demonstrated. On solvent-free solid state surfaces, the sensitivity of the IR-786 to CN(-) in water samples was in the range of 50-300 μM with minimal interference by OH(-).",,,"Anions, Carbocyanines, Cyanides, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indoles, Solvents, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Water, Water Pollutants, Chemical",,
26914281,Doping Evolution and Junction Formation in Stacked Cyanine Dye Light-Emitting Electrochemical Cells.,"Cyanine dyes are fluorescent organic salts with intrinsic conductivity for ionic and electronic charges. Recently ( J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2013 , 135 , 18008 - 18011 ), these features have been exploited in cyanine light-emitting electrochemical cells (LECs). Here, we demonstrate that stacked, constant-voltage driven trimethine cyanine LECs with various counteranions develop a p-i-n junction that is composed of p- and n-doped zones and an intrinsic region where light-emission occurs. We introduce a method that combines spectral photocurrent response measurements with optical modeling and find that at maximum current the intrinsic region is centered at ∼37% away from the anode. Transient capacitance, photoluminescence and attenuance experiments indicate a device situation with a narrow p-doped region, an undoped region that occupies ∼72% of the dye layer thickness and an n-doped region with a maximum doping concentration of 0.08 dopant/cyanine molecule. Finally, we observe that during device relaxation the parent cyanines are not reformed. We ascribe this to irreversible reactions between doped cyanine radicals. For sterically conservative cyanine dyes, this suggests that undesired radical decomposition pathways limit the LEC long-term stability in general.",,,,,
26838896,Stable non-covalent labeling of layered silicate nanoparticles for biological imaging.,"Layered silicate nanoparticles (LSN) are widely used in industrial applications and consumer products. They also have potential benefits in biomedical applications such as implantable devices and for drug delivery. To study how nanomaterials interact with cells and tissues, techniques to track and quantify their movement through different biological compartments are essential. While radiolabels can be very sensitive, particularly for in vivo studies, fluorescent labeling has been preferred in recent years because of the array of methods available to image and quantify fluorescent nanoparticles. However, labeling can be problematic, especially if it alters the physical properties of the nanomaterial. Herein is described a novel non-covalent labeling technique for LSN using readily available fluorescent dimeric cyanine dyes without the need to use excess amounts of dye to achieve labeling, or the need for removal of unbound dye. The approach utilizes the cationic binding properties of layered silicate clays and the multiple quaternary nitrogens associated with the dyes. Preparation of YOYO-1 labeled LSN with optimal dispersion in aqueous media is presented. The utilization of the labeled particles is then demonstrated in cell binding and uptake studies using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The labeled LSN are highly fluorescent, stable and exhibit identical physical properties with respect to the unlabeled nanoparticles. The general approach described here is applicable to other cyanine dyes and may be utilized more widely for labeling nanoparticles that comprise a crystalline plate structure with a high binding capacity.",,,"Benzoxazoles, Cell Line, Fluorescent Dyes, HeLa Cells, Humans, Microscopy, Confocal, Nanoparticles, Quinolinium Compounds, Silicates",,

DTDC forms chiral H- and J-aggregates, whereas DTC and DTTHC are unable to form any aggregates. DTDC also forms H- and J-aggregates in the presence of sodium polyacrylate (PA) with a random-coil structure; however, the PA-DTDC aggregates exhibit no chirality. These results suggest that the chirality of HA-DTDC aggregates is induced by the helical structure of HA. In 2.4 vol% and 10 vol% methanol, HA-DTDC aggregates displayed different patterns of temperature dependence, whereas no aggregation was observed in 30 vol% methanol. The solubility of DTDC in a mixed solvent of water and methanol is generally improved by the addition of methanol, which prevents the aggregation of DTDC.",,,"Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, Coloring Agents, Hyaluronic Acid, Molecular Structure, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet, Temperature",,

We recently demonstrated that a new class of NIR cyanine dyes containing a novel C4'-O-alkyl linker exhibit greater chemical stability and excellent optical properties relative to existing C4'-O-aryl variants. We synthesized two NIR cyanine dyes with the same core structure but different indolenine substituents: FNIR-774 bearing four sulfonate groups and FNIR-Z-759 bearing a combination of two sulfonates and two quaternary ammonium cations, resulting in an anionic (-3) or monocationic (+1) charge, respectively. In this study, we compare the in vitro and in vivo optical imaging properties of monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugates of FNIR-774 and FNIR-Z-759 with panitumumab (pan) at antibody-to-dye ratios of 1:2 or 1:5. Conjugates of both dyes demonstrated similar quenching capacity, stability, and brightness in target cells in vitro. However, FNIR-Z-759 conjugates showed significantly lower background in mice, resulting in higher tumor-to-background ratio. Thus, FNIR-Z-759 conjugates appear to have superior in vivo imaging characteristics compared with FNIR-774 conjugates, especially in the abdominal region, regardless of the dye-mAb ratio.

26358819,Development of photostabilized asymmetrical cyanine dyes for in vivo photoacoustic imaging of tumors.,"Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) contributes to tumor diagnosis through the use of PAI probes that effectively accumulate in tumors. Previously, we developed a symmetrical cyanine dye, IC7-1-Bu, which showed high potential as a PAI probe because of its high tumor targeting ability and sufficient in vivo PA signal. However, IC7-1-Bu lacks photostability for multiple laser irradiations, so we developed stabilized PAI probes using IC7-1-Bu as a lead compound. We focused on the effect of singlet oxygen (1O2) generated by excited PAI probes on probe degeneration. We introduced a triplet-state quencher (TSQ) moiety into IC7-1-Bu to quench 1O2 generation and designed three IC-n-T derivatives with different linker lengths (n indicates linker length). The IC-n-T derivatives emitted in vitro PA signals that were comparable to IC7-1-Bu and significantly reduced 1O2 generation while showing improved photostability against multiple irradiations. Of the three derivatives evaluated, IC-5-T accumulated in tumors effectively to allow clear PAI of tumors in vivo. Furthermore, the photostability of IC-5-T was 1.5-fold higher than that of IC7-1-Bu in in vivo sequential PAI. These results suggest that IC-5-T is a potential PAI probe for in vivo sequential tumor imaging.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Female, HeLa Cells, Humans, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Photoacoustic Techniques, Protein Binding, Serum Albumin, Bovine",,

We describe herein, as proof of concept, the prototype of the first asymmetric MoCryp system, based on an 8-compound set of a novel bioinspired class of cyanine-type dyes called trichocyanines. These novel acidichromic cyanine-type dyes inspired by red hair pigments were synthesized and characterized with the aid of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The eight representative members synthesized herein can be classified as belonging to two three-state systems tunable through four different control points.

The observed spectral shifts are consistent with calculated HOMO-LUMO energy gaps and reflect electron density localization on the quinoline half of TO in the LUMO.

26094622,"2, 2'- and 4, 4'-Cyanines are transporter-independent in vitro dopaminergic toxins with the specificity and mechanism of toxicity similar to MPP⁺.","Specific uptake through dopamine transporter followed by the inhibition of the mitochondrial complex-I have been accepted as the cause of the specific dopaminergic toxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+) ). However, MPP(+) is taken up into many cell types through other transporters, suggesting that, in addition to the efficient uptake, intrinsic vulnerability of dopaminergic cells may also contribute to their high sensitivity to MPP(+) and similar toxins. To test this possibility, two simple cyanines were employed in a comparative study based on their unique characteristics and structural similarity to MPP(+) . Here, we show that they freely accumulate in dopaminergic (MN9D and SH-SY5Y) as well as in liver (HepG2) cells, but are specifically and highly toxic to dopaminergic cells with IC50s in the range of 50-100 nM, demonstrating that they are about 1000-fold more toxic than MPP(+) under similar experimental conditions. They cause mitochondrial depolarization non-specifically, but increase the reactive oxygen species specifically in dopaminergic cells leading to the apoptotic cell death parallel to MPP(+) . These and other findings suggest that the specific dopaminergic toxicity of these cyanines is due to the inherent vulnerability of dopaminergic cells toward mitochondrial toxins that lead to the excessive production of reactive oxygen species. Therefore, the specific dopaminergic toxicity of MPP(+) must also be, at least partly, due to the specific vulnerability of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, these cyanines could be stronger in vivo dopaminergic toxins than MPP(+) and their in vivo toxicities must be evaluated. Here, we show that cationic lipophilic cyanines with structural similarity to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+) ) freely accumulate non-specifically, but only toxic to dopaminergic cells. They are 1000-fold more toxic than MPP(+) under similar conditions. They cause mitochondrial depolarization non-specifically, but increase the ROS specifically in dopaminergic cells leading to the apoptotic cell death parallel to MPP(+) .

The formation of a strong absorption band in dye monomers and a J-band in their aggregates is uniformly explained from the electron-nuclear resonance condition. The redistribution of optical band intensities among cyanine dyes with the solvent is also explained. The dependence of the possibility of J-band formation in aggregates on the dye structure is successfully predicted. The results presented provide an insight for rational molecular design and application of polymethine dyes.,,,,,
26087392,Hydrogen-Bonded Multifunctional Supramolecular Copolymers in Water.,"We have investigated the self-assembly in water of molecules having a single hydrophobic bis-urea domain linked to different hydrophilic functional side chains, i.e., bioactive peptidic residues and fluorescent cyanine dyes. By using a combination of spectroscopy, scattering, and microscopy techniques, we show that each one of these molecules can individually produce well-defined nanostructures such as twisted ribbons, two-dimensional plates, or branched fibers. Interestingly, when these monomers of different functionalities are mixed in an equimolar ratio, supramolecular copolymers are preferred to narcissistic segregation. Radiation scattering and imaging techniques demonstrate that one of the molecular units dictates the formation of a preferential nanostructure, and optical spectroscopies reveal the alternated nature of the copolymerization process. This work illustrates how social self-sorting in H-bond supramolecular polymers can give straightforward access to multifunctional supramolecular copolymers.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen Bonding, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Peptides, Polymers, Solubility, Urea, Water",,
26084388,The impact of DNA intercalators on DNA and DNA-processing enzymes elucidated through force-dependent binding kinetics.,"DNA intercalators are widely used as fluorescent probes to visualize DNA and DNA transactions in vivo and in vitro. It is well known that they perturb DNA structure and stability, which can in turn influence DNA-processing by proteins. Here we elucidate this perturbation by combining single-dye fluorescence microscopy with force spectroscopy and measuring the kinetics of DNA intercalation by the mono- and bis-intercalating cyanine dyes SYTOX Orange, SYTOX Green, SYBR Gold, YO-PRO-1, YOYO-1 and POPO-3. We show that their DNA-binding affinity is mainly governed by a strongly tension-dependent dissociation rate. These rates can be tuned over a range of seven orders of magnitude by changing DNA tension, intercalating species and ionic strength. We show that optimizing these rates minimizes the impact of intercalators on strand separation and enzymatic activity. These new insights provide handles for the improved use of intercalators as DNA probes with minimal perturbation and maximal efficacy.",,,"DNA, DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase, Intercalating Agents, Kinetics, Kymography",,
25969803,Development of a wavelength-shifting fluorescent module for the adenosine aptamer using photostable cyanine dyes.,"DNA-based aptamers are commonly used recognition elements in biosensors for a range of target molecules. Here, the development of a wavelength-shifting optical module for a DNA-based adenosine-binding aptamer is described. It applies the combination of two photostable cyanine-styryl dyes as covalent modifications. This energy-transfer pair is postsynthetically attached to oligonucleotides via a copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition by two structurally different approaches: 1) as nucleotide modifications at the 2'-position of uridines and 2) as nucleotide substitutions using (S)-amino-1,2-propanediol as acyclic linker between the phosphodiester bridges. Both dyes exhibit a remarkable photostability. A library of DNA aptamers consisting of different combinations of the two dyes in diagonal orientations were evaluated by their emission color contrast as readout. Further optimization led to aptasensors with improved fluorescent readout as compared with previously reported aptasensors. This approach described is synthetically facile using simple propargylated phosphoramidites as DNA building blocks. As such, this approach could be applied for other dyes and other chemical/biological applications.",,,,,
25963892,"Trimethine cyanine dyes as fluorescent probes for amyloid fibrils: The effect of N,N'-substituents.","The effect of various N,N'-substituents in the molecule of benzothiazole trimethine cyanine dye on its ability to sense the amyloid aggregates of protein was studied. The dyes are low fluorescent when free and in the presence of monomeric proteins, but their emission intensity sharply increases in complexes with aggregated insulin and lysozyme, with the fluorescence quantum yield reaching up to 0.42. The dyes carrying butyl, hydroxyalkyl, and phenylalkyl groups as N,N'-substituents possess the increased fluorescent sensitivity to fibrillar lysozyme, whereas the ones carrying quaternary amino groups are preferably sensitive to fibrillar insulin. This fluorescent sensitivity preference provided by the N,N'-functional groups could be explained by the interaction between these groups and protein side chains. The strongest fluorescent response (up to 70times) and the same sensitivity to aggregates of both proteins were exhibited by the dye D-51 carrying N-sulfoalkyl group. The studied cyanines allow the detection of fibrillar aggregates in the wide range up to 0.8 to 300μg/ml and permit monitoring the protein aggregation kinetics with high reproducibility. The modification of trimethine cyanine dyes by functional substituents in N,N'-positions is suggested as a tool for the design of fluorescent molecules with the enhanced fluorescent sensitivity to the fibrillar aggregates of proteins.",,,"Amyloid, Buffers, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Insulin, Kinetics, Limit of Detection, Muramidase, Protein Aggregates, Protein Multimerization, Protein Structure, Secondary, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Structure-Activity Relationship",,
25923361,Ultrasensitive near-infrared fluorescence-enhanced probe for in vivo nitroreductase imaging.,"Nitroreductase (NTR) can be overexpressed in hypoxic tumors, thus the selective and efficient detection of NTR is of great importance. To date, although a few optical methods have been reported for the detection of NTR in solution, an effective optical probe for NTR monitoring in vivo is still lacking. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent detection probe for NTR. In this study, five NIR cyanine dyes with fluorescence reporting structure decorated with different nitro aromatic groups, Cy7-1-5, have been designed and explored for possible rapid detection of NTR. Our experimental results presented that only a para-nitro benzoate group modified cyanine probe (Cy7-1) could serve as a rapid NIR fluorescence-enhanced probe for monitoring and bioimaging of NTR. The structure-function relationship has been revealed by theoretical study. The linker connecting the detecting and fluorescence reporting groups and the nitro group position is a key factor for the formation of hydrogen bonds and spatial structure match, inducing the NTR catalytic ability enhancement. The in vitro response and mechanism of the enzyme-catalyzed reduction of Cy7-1 have been investigated through kinetic optical studies and other methods. The results have indicated that an electro-withdrawing group induced electron-transfer process becomes blocked when Cy7-1 is catalytically reduced to Cy7-NH2 by NTR, which is manifested in enhanced fluorescence intensity during the detection process. Confocal fluorescence imaging of hypoxic A549 cells has confirmed the NTR detection ability of Cy7-1 at the cellular level. Importantly, Cy7-1 can detect tumor hypoxia in a murine hypoxic tumor model, showing a rapid and significant enhancement of its NIR fluorescence characteristics suitable for fluorescence bioimaging. This method may potentially be used for tumor hypoxia diagnosis.",,,"Animals, Benzothiazoles, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Hypoxia, Mice, Microscopy, Confocal, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Molecular Docking Simulation, Neoplasms, Nitroreductases, Optical Imaging, Whole Body Imaging",,
25898141,Highly sensitive naphthalimide-based fluorescence polarization probe for detecting cancer cells.,"Fluorescence polarization (FP)-based signal is a self-referencing fluorescence signal, and it is less dependent on dye concentration and environmental interferences, which makes FP measurement an attractive alternative sensing technology to fluorescence intensity-based detection. However, most of the fluorescence polarization probes were constructed by introducing fluorescein, rhodamine, and cyanine dyes, which have relatively shorter excited-state lifetimes compared with BODIPY and naphthalimide dyes. Herein, a first naphthalimide based fluorescence polarization probe (BIO) was designed and synthesized for selective and direct detection of cancer cells. The relatively longer excited-state lifetimes and high photostability of naphthalimide makes BIO more sensitive and accuracy in quantitative determination of HeLa cells in homogeneous solution without cell lysis and further separation steps. The detection limit of BIO for HeLa cells was about 85 cells mL(-1), the linear range was from 2.5 × 10(2) cells mL(-1) to 1 × 10(6) cells mL(-1) and the response time is no more than 25 min. Moreover, due to the relatively high photostability of naphthalimide, BIO was particularly suitable for live cell imaging under continuous irradiation with confocal microscopy, and the specific interaction of BIO with CD44-overexpressing cell lines was clearly visualized. Importantly, this BIO based sensing platform offers a direct and real-time tool for cancer cell diagnosis when complemented with the use of naphthalimide-based fluorescence polarization probe.",,,"Cell Survival, Endocytosis, Fluorescence Polarization, Fluorescent Dyes, HeLa Cells, Humans, Hyaluronan Receptors, Lysosomes, Naphthalimides, Neoplasms, Subcellular Fractions",,

Clinical and preclinical applications include intraoperative imaging, tracking therapeutics, and fluorescent labeling as a surrogate for subsequent radiolabeling. Despite their extensive use, one of the fundamental properties of NIR dyes, the residualization rate within cells following internalization, has not been systematically studied. This rate is required for the rational design of probes and proper interpretation of in vivo results. In this brief report, we measure the cellular residualization rate of eight commonly used dyes encompassing three core structures (cyanine, boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY), and oxazine/thiazine/carbopyronin). We identify residualizing (half-life >24 h) and non-residualizing (half-life <24 h) dyes in both the far-red (~650-680 nm) and near-infrared (~740-800 nm) regions.

Analysis of the (1) H NMR spectra indicates that the ""charge-separated"" species dominates in these dyes, given that carbons possessing a positive or negative charge in the resonance structures of this state purposefully shift downfield or upfield, respectively, depending on the strength of the acceptor moiety. In DAA-Fl-PI, the acceptor strength and the gain of acceptor aromaticity indicates a predisposition of the separated state, indicated by asymmetry in the (1) H NMR spectrum, as well as uneven distribution of the HOMO on the fluorenyl donor.",,,,,
29449923,Photoinduced dynamics of a cyanine dye: parallel pathways of non-radiative deactivation involving multiple excited-state twisted transients.,"Cyanine dyes are broadly used for fluorescence imaging and other photonic applications. 3,3'-Diethylthiacyanine (THIA) is a cyanine dye composed of two identical aromatic heterocyclic moieties linked with a single methine, -CH[double bond, length as m-dash]. The torsional degrees of freedom around the methine bonds provide routes for non-radiative decay, responsible for the inherently low fluorescence quantum yields. Using transient absorption spectroscopy, we determined that upon photoexcitation, the excited state relaxes along two parallel pathways producing three excited-state transients that undergo internal conversion to the ground state. The media viscosity impedes the molecular modes of ring rotation and preferentially affects one of the pathways of non-radiative decay, exerting a dominant effect on the emission properties of THIA. Concurrently, the polarity affects the energy of the transients involved in the decay pathways and further modulates the kinetics of non-radiative deactivation.",,,,,
25811535,Glycerol-based contrast agents: a novel series of dendronized pentamethine dyes.,"The synthesis of water-soluble dyes, which absorb and emit in the range between 650 and 950 nm and display high extinction coefficients (ε) as well as high fluorescence quantum yields (Φf), is still a demand for optical imaging. We now present a synthetic route for the preparation of a new group of glycerol-substituted cyanine dyes from dendronized indole precursors that have been functionalized as N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters. High Φf values of up to 0.15 and extinction coefficients of up to 189 000 L mol(-1) cm(-1) were obtained for the pure dyes. Furthermore, conjugates of the new dendronized dyes with the antibody cetuximab (ctx) that were directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) of tumor cells could be prepared with dye to protein ratios between 0.3 and 2.2 to assess their potential as imaging probes. For the first time, ctx conjugates could be achieved without showing a decrease in Φf and with an increasing labeling degree that exceeded the value of the pure dye even at a labeling degree above 2. The incorporation of hydrophilically and sterically demanding dendrimers into cyanines prevented dimer formation after covalent conjugation to the antibody. The binding functionality of the resulting ctx conjugates to the EGFR was successfully demonstrated by cell microscopy studies using EGFR expressing cell lines. In summary, the combination of hydrophilic glycerol dendrons with reactive dye labels has been established for the first time and is a promising approach toward more powerful fluorescent labels with less dimerization.",,,"Antineoplastic Agents, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cetuximab, Contrast Media, Dendrimers, Epithelial Cells, ErbB Receptors, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Expression, Glycerol, Humans, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Immunoconjugates, Indoles, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Optical Imaging, Staining and Labeling",,
25805562,Comparative biodistribution in mice of cyanine dyes loaded in lipid nanoparticles.,"Two near infrared cyanine dyes, DiD (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine perchlorate) and ICG (Indocyanine Green) were loaded in lipid nanoparticles (LNP). DiD-LNP and ICG-LNP presented similar physicochemical characteristics (hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity, zeta potential), encapsulation efficiency, and colloidal stability when stored in PBS buffer. However, whereas DiD had similar biodistribution than cholesteryl-1-(14)C-oleate ([(14)C]CHO, a constituent of the nanoparticle used as a reference radiotracer), ICG displayed a different biodistribution pattern, similar to that of the free dye, indicative of its immediate leakage from the nanovector after blood injection. NMR spectroscopy using Proton NOE (Nuclear Overhauser Effect) measurements showed that the localization of the dye in the lipid nanoparticles was slightly different: ICG, more amphiphilic than DiD, was found both inside the lipid core and at particle interface, whereas DiD, more hydrophobic, appeared exclusively located inside the particle core. The ICG release rate from the particles was 7% per 1 month under storage conditions (4 °C, dark, 10% of lipids), whereas no leakage could be detected for DiD. ICG leakage increased considerably in the presence of BSA 40 g/L (45% leakage in 24h at 100 mg/mL of lipids), because of the high affinity of the fluorophore for plasma proteins. On the contrary, no DiD leakage was observed, until high dilution of the nanoparticles which triggered their dissociation (45% leakage in 24h at 1 mg/mL of lipids). Altogether, the subtle difference in dye localization into the nanoparticles, the partial dissociation of the LNP in diluted media, and more importantly the high ICG affinity for plasma proteins, accounted for the differences observed in the fluorescence biodistribution after tail vein injection of the dye-loaded nanoparticles.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Drug Carriers, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Indocyanine Green, Injections, Intravenous, Lipids, Mice, Nanoparticles, Nanotechnology, Particle Size, Protein Binding, Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Solubility, Tissue Distribution",,
25763888,Tailoring cyanine dark states for improved optically modulated fluorescence recovery.,"Cyanine dyes are well-known for their bright fluorescence and utility in biological imaging. However, cyanines also readily photoisomerize to produce nonemissive dark states. Co-illumination with a secondary, red-shifted light source on-resonance with the longer wavelength absorbing dark state reverses the photoisomerization and returns the cyanine dye to the fluorescent manifold, increasing steady-state fluorescence intensity. Modulation of this secondary light source dynamically alters emission intensity, drastically improving detection sensitivity and facilitating fluorescence signals to be recovered from an otherwise overwhelming background. Red and near-IR emitting cyanine derivatives have been synthesized with varying alkyl chain lengths and halogen substituents to alter dual-laser fluorescence enhancement. Photophysical properties and enhancement with dual laser modulation were coupled with density functional calculations to characterize substituent effects on dark state photophysics, potentially improving detection in high background biological environments.",,,"Carbocyanines, Darkness, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Lasers, Models, Chemical, Photochemical Processes, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
25752055,[Investigation on the cyanine dyes supramolecular assembly and chiral inducement by fulvic acid].,"Using cyanine dyes supramolecular as molecular probes to mark FA has important significance in life sciences and pharmaceutical chemistry, which can detect FA as drug efficacy mechanism and the change in physiological activity. In the present paper, we investigated supramolecular assembly and chiral inducement of cyanine dyes template by FA with absorption and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. The result suggests that FA can induce cyanine dyes from J-aggregation to monomer along with different colors change and has strong affinity with cyanine dye monomer. The template of FA not only can translate the chirality of MTC H-aggregation to other two states, but also induce ETC J-aggregation to molecular rearrangement and form left-handed helix of J-aggregates. Besides, the association of PTC with FA, i. e. binding to FA gave rise to the J-aggregation CD signals. Meanwhile, it was inferred that the meso substituent of cyanine dyes play an important role in the interaction between FA and the J-aggregation: the smaller the meso substituent, the higher the affinity interacted with FA. Clearly, the binding abilities between cyanine dyes and FA follow the order of MTC>ETC>PTC. These results support that the cyanine dyes supramolecular aggregates can be used as a kind of excellent molecular probes for specific recognition of FA and achieve the effect of visual inspection.",,,"Benzopyrans, Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, Coloring Agents, Macromolecular Substances",,
25710687,Taking up the cyanine challenge with quantum tools.,"Cyanine derivatives, named from the Greek word kyanos meaning dark-blue, were discovered more than 150 years ago and remain one of the most widely used classes of organic dyes with contemporary applications in photography (panchromatic emulsions), information storage (CD-R and DVD-R media) and biochemistry (DNA and protein labeling) fields. Cyanine chromogens consist of a charged π-conjugated segment containing an odd number of sp(2) carbon atoms with the chain capped at the extremities by two electronegative centers, typically nitrogen or oxygen atoms. Cyanines are characterized by a vanishing bond length alternation indicating nearly equal carbon-carbon bond lengths, as well as a very intense and sharp absorption band presenting a shoulder. This hallmark band undergoes a strong red shift when the chain is extended. This so-called vinyl shift is extremely large (ca. 100 nm for each pair of carbon atoms added in the π-conjugated path), making cyanines ideal building blocks for the design of devices with near-infrared applications. Numerous cyanines also exhibit emission bands with large quantum yields. These exceptional optical properties explain why both canonical cyanines and the corresponding fluoroborates (e.g., boron-dipyrromethene, BODIPY) remain the focus of an ever-growing body of experimental work. In turn, this popularity has stimulated quantum mechanical investigations aiming, on the one hand, at probing the specific electronic nature of cyanine dyes and, on the other hand, at helping to design new dyes. However, the adiabatic approximation to time-dependent density functional theory, the most widespread ab initio model for electronically excited states, fails to accurately reproduce the absorption spectra of cyanine derivatives: it yields a systematic and large underestimation of the experimental wavelengths irrespective of the details of the computational protocol. In contrast, highly correlated wave function approaches provide accurate transition energies for model systems but are hardly applicable to real-life cyanines and BODIPY. This indicates that setting up a computationally tractable theoretical protocol that provides both robust and accurate optical spectra for cyanine-based dyes is a major challenge that has only been taken up lately. In this Account, we compile the most recent advances in the field by considering both compact streptocyanines and large fluoroborates. For the former, we summarize the key results obtained with a large panel of theoretical approaches, allowing us not only to understand the origin of the cyanine challenge but also to pinpoint the schemes presenting the most promising accuracy/effort ratio. For the latter, we show via selected examples how theoretical models can be used to reproduce simultaneously experimental band shapes and transition energies, thus paving the way to an efficient in silico design of new compounds.",,,,,
25703366,Relation of molecular structure to Franck-Condon bands in the visible-light absorption spectra of symmetric cationic cyanine dyes.,"A Franck-Condon (FC) model is used to study the solution-phase absorbance spectra of a series of seven symmetric cyanine dyes having between 22 and 77 atoms. Electronic transition energies were obtained from routine visible-light absorbance and fluorescence emission spectra. Harmonic normal modes were computed using density functional theory (DFT) and a polarizable continuum solvent model (PCM), with frequencies corrected using measured mid-infrared spectra. The model predicts the relative energies of the two major vibronic bands to within 5% and 11%, respectively, and also reproduces structure-specific differences in vibronic band shapes. The bands themselves result from excitation of two distinct subsets of normal modes, one with frequencies between 150 and 625cm(-1), and the other between 850 and 1480cm(-1). Vibronic transitions excite symmetric in-plane bending of the polymethine chain, in-plane bends of the polymethine and aromatic C-H bonds, torsions and deformations of N-alkyl substituents, and in the case of the indocyanines, in-plane deformations of the indole rings.

25645886,Cy3 and Cy5 dyes attached to oligonucleotide terminus stabilize DNA duplexes: predictive thermodynamic model.,"Cyanine dyes are important chemical modifications of oligonucleotides exhibiting intensive and stable fluorescence at visible light wavelengths. When Cy3 or Cy5 dye is attached to 5' end of a DNA duplex, the dye stacks on the terminal base pair and stabilizes the duplex. Using optical melting experiments, we have determined thermodynamic parameters that can predict the effects of the dyes on duplex stability quantitatively (ΔG°, Tm). Both Cy dyes enhance duplex formation by 1.2 kcal/mol on average, however, this Gibbs energy contribution is sequence-dependent. If the Cy5 is attached to a pyrimidine nucleotide of pyrimidine-purine base pair, the stabilization is larger compared to the attachment to a purine nucleotide. This is likely due to increased stacking interactions of the dye to the purine of the complementary strand. Dangling (unpaired) nucleotides at duplex terminus are also known to enhance duplex stability. Stabilization originated from the Cy dyes is significantly larger than the stabilization due to the presence of dangling nucleotides. If both the dangling base and Cy3 are present, their thermodynamic contributions are approximately additive. New thermodynamic parameters improve predictions of duplex folding, which will help design oligonucleotide sequences for biophysical, biological, engineering, and nanotechnology applications.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Models, Chemical, Oligonucleotides, Thermodynamics, Ultraviolet Rays",,

This behaviour might result from their binding with G-quadruplex: the two chromophores of dimers stack on both ends of G-quadruplexes while the linker between two chromophores of dimers binds to the loops and grooves cooperatively.

Novel styryl homodimers and monomethine cyanine dyes were synthesized and their staining abilities for discrimination between live and dead lactic acid bacterial cells were investigated. The dyes were combined in pairs based on their excitation and emission maxima and the capacity to penetrate through cell membranes of viable bacterial cells. The absorption maxima in the same region and the large Stocks shifts of the styryl derivatives allowed viability analysis to be done with epifluorescent microscope with a very basic configuration - one light source about 480nm and one filter for the fluorescent emissions. A staining protocol was developed and applied for live/dead analysis of Bulgarian yoghurt starters. The live cells quantification by the fluorescence dyes coincided well with the results of the much more time-consuming tests by plate counting.

25587738,Molecular design of boronic acid-functionalized squarylium cyanine dyes for multiple discriminant analysis of sialic acid in biological samples: selectivity toward monosaccharides controlled by different alkyl side chain lengths.,"We designed a new series of boronic acid-functionalized squarylium cyanine dyes (SQ-BA) with different lengths of alkyl chain residues, suitable for multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) of sialic acid (Neu5Ac) in biological samples. The SQ-BA dyes form aggregates based on hydrophobic interactions, which result in quenched fluorescence in aqueous solutions. When the boronic acid binds with saccharides, the fluorescence intensity increases as a result of dissociation to the emissive monomeric complex. We inferred that different dye aggregate structures (H-aggregates and J-aggregates) were induced depending on the alkyl chain length, so that monosaccharides would be recognized in different ways (especially, multipoint interaction with J-aggregates). A distinctive emission enhancement of SQ-BA dyes with shorter-alkyl-chains in the presence of Neu5Ac was observed (2.4-fold fluorescence enhancement; with formation constant 10(1.7) M(-1)), with no such enhancement for SQ-BA dyes with longer-alkyl-chain. In addition, various enhancement factors for other monosaccharides were observed depending on the alkyl chain length. Detailed thermodynamic and NMR studies of the SQ-BA complexes revealed the unique recognition mechanism: the dye aggregate with a shorter-alkyl-chain causes the slipped parallel structure and forms a stable 2:1 complex with Neu5Ac, as distinct from longer-alkyl-chain dyes, which form a 1:1 monomeric complex. MDA using the four SQ-BA dyes was performed for human urine samples, resulting in the successful discrimination between normal and abnormal Neu5Ac levels characteristic of disease. Thus, we successfully controlled various responses to similar monosaccharides with a novel approach that chemically modified not the boronic acid moiety itself but the length of the alkyl chain residue attached to the dye in order to generate specificity.",,,"Boronic Acids, Coloring Agents, Discriminant Analysis, Humans, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Models, Molecular, Monosaccharides, N-Acetylneuraminic Acid, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

No significant decrease in RGC numbers was observed. No structural changes of the central retina were observed either in vivo (OCT) or under light microscopy. ERGs detected a temporary reduction of retinal function 7 days after injection; this was no longer evident 14 days after injection. DSS showed good biocompatibility in a well-established experimental in vivo setting and may be usable for intraocular surgery as an alternative to other cyanine dyes.

In this work, we report on the study of the BCD photocytotoxicity toward melanoma and normal cells in comparison with that of commercial photosensitizer Photogem®. The cytotoxic and phototoxic effects were measured by standard tests of cell viability. The drug uptake was obtained by the flow cytometry and optical absorption techniques. The BCD intracellular distribution was obtained by the fluorescence image microscopy using specific organelle markers. Both drugs demonstrated increased cytotoxicity under irradiation, while in darkness their cytotoxic effect at concentrations lower than 20 μM after 24 h of incubation did not exceed 20%. For 5 h of incubation, BCD photocytotoxicity in relation to melanoma cells reached 100% already at concentrations below 5 μM, while for normal cells the effect did not exceed 70% even for the 20 μM concentration. It is shown that BCD penetrates into the cells and is located predominantly in perinuclear cytoplasmic structures. The BCD photosensitizing characteristics appear more adequate for application in PDT than that of the actually applied commercial photosensitizer Photogem®. Higher light absorption by BCD in the near IR region and its preferential localization in mitochondria can explain its high photocytotoxicity. BCD can be considered as a new promising photosensitizer class for cancer PDT.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Survival, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Fluorescent Dyes, Hematoporphyrins, Humans, Inhibitory Concentration 50, Melanoma, Experimental, Mice, Permeability, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Time Factors",,
25475647,Clozapine influences cytoskeleton structure and calcium homeostasis in rat cerebral cortex and has a different proteomic profile than risperidone.,"For over the last 50 years, the molecular mechanism of anti-psychotic drugs' action has been far from clear. While risperidone is very often used in clinical practice, the most efficient known anti-psychotic drug is clozapine (CLO). However, the biochemical background of CLO's action still remains elusive. In this study, we performed comparative proteomic analysis of rat cerebral cortex following chronic administration of these two drugs. We observed significant changes in the expression of cytoskeletal, synaptic, and regulatory proteins caused by both antipsychotics. Among other proteins, alterations in collapsin response mediator proteins, CRMP2 and CRMP4, were the most spectacular consequences of treatment with both drugs. Moreover, risperidone increased the level of proteins involved in cell proliferation such as fatty acid-binding protein-7 and translin-associated factor X. CLO significantly up-regulated the expression of visinin-like protein 1, neurocalcin δ and mitochondrial, stomatin-like protein 2, the calcium-binding proteins regulating calcium homeostasis, and the functioning of ion channels and receptors. Using two-dimensional differential electrophoresis, we demonstrate that chronic treatment the healthy rats with anti-psychotics, clozapine and risperidone, induce changes in expression of cytoskeletal, synaptic, and regulatory proteins in the cerebral cortex. While risperidone increases the level of proteins regulating cell proliferation, namely, fatty acid-binding protein-7 and translin-associated factor X, the clozapine significantly up-regulates calcium sensors, i.e., visinin-like protein 1 and neurocalcin δ. 2D DIGE, Differential in Gel Electrophoresis; Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 are cyanine dyes.",,,"Animals, Antipsychotic Agents, Calcium, Cerebral Cortex, Clozapine, Cytoskeleton, Homeostasis, Male, Proteomics, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Risperidone",,
25408468,A unique type of pyrrole-based cyanine fluorophores with turn-on and ratiometric fluorescence signals at different pH regions for sensing pH in enzymes and living cells.,"The development of new functional fluorescent dyes has attracted great attention. Herein we have described a novel strategy to design a unique type of cyanine dyes by attaching two indolium moieties at the α-positions of the pyrrole core. The new type of cyanine dyes is named as PyCy fluorophores. Importantly, PyCy dyes can exhibit an exceptional feature, fluorescence turn-on response at pH varying from acidic to near-neutral conditions, and a ratiometric fluorescence response at pH varying from near-neutral to basic conditions. By taking advantage of the fluorescence turn-on response of PyCy2 at pH varying from acidic to near-neutral conditions and emission properties of PyCy2, we have demonstrated that a small-molecule fluorescent probe can image pH variations in living cells. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that PyCy2 can sense real-time pH changes under alkaline conditions induced by enzymes based on the ratiometric fluorescence response of PyCy2 at pH varying from near-neutral to basic conditions. We expect that the new design strategy for PyCy fluorophores may prompt the development of a wide variety of cyanine derivatives with desirable properties.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Materials Testing, Pyrroles, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
25408153,Proteomic profiling of macrophages by 2D electrophoresis.,"The goal of the two-dimensional (2D) electrophoresis protocol described here is to show how to analyse the phenotype of human cultured macrophages. The key role of macrophages has been shown in various pathological disorders such as inflammatory, immunological, and infectious diseases. In this protocol, we use primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages that can be differentiated into the M1 (pro-inflammatory) or the M2 (anti-inflammatory) phenotype. This in vitro model is reliable for studying the biological activities of M1 and M2 macrophages and also for a proteomic approach. Proteomic techniques are useful for comparing the phenotype and behaviour of M1 and M2 macrophages during host pathogenicity. 2D gel electrophoresis is a powerful proteomic technique for mapping large numbers of proteins or polypeptides simultaneously. We describe the protocol of 2D electrophoresis using fluorescent dyes, named 2D Differential Gel Electrophoresis (DIGE). The M1 and M2 macrophages proteins are labelled with cyanine dyes before separation by isoelectric focusing, according to their isoelectric point in the first dimension, and their molecular mass, in the second dimension. Separated protein or polypeptidic spots are then used to detect differences in protein or polypeptide expression levels. The proteomic approaches described here allows the investigation of the macrophage protein changes associated with various disorders like host pathogenicity or microbial toxins.",,,"Cell Differentiation, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Isoelectric Focusing, Macrophages, Peptides, Phenotype, Proteins, Proteomics",,
25397906,Resonance energy transfer in DNA duplexes labeled with localized dyes.,"The growing maturity of DNA-based architectures has raised considerable interest in applying them to create photoactive light harvesting and sensing devices. Toward optimizing efficiency in such structures, resonant energy transfer was systematically examined in a series of dye-labeled DNA duplexes where donor-acceptor separation was incrementally changed from 0 to 16 base pairs. Cyanine dyes were localized on the DNA using double phosphoramidite attachment chemistry. Steady state spectroscopy, single-pair fluorescence, time-resolved fluorescence, and ultrafast two-color pump-probe methods were utilized to examine the energy transfer processes. Energy transfer rates were found to be more sensitive to the distance between the Cy3 donor and Cy5 acceptor dye molecules than efficiency measurements. Picosecond energy transfer and near-unity efficiencies were observed for the closest separations. Comparison between our measurements and the predictions of Förster theory based on structural modeling of the dye-labeled DNA duplex suggest that the double phosphoramidite linkage leads to a distribution of intercalated and nonintercalated dye orientations. Deviations from the predictions of Förster theory point to a failure of the point dipole approximation for separations of less than 10 base pairs. Interactions between the dyes that alter their optical properties and violate the weak-coupling assumption of Förster theory were observed for separations of less than four base pairs, suggesting the removal of nucleobases causes DNA deformation and leads to enhanced dye-dye interaction.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Models, Molecular, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Nucleic Acid Heteroduplexes, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectrum Analysis",,
25390362,In singulo probing of viral RNA dynamics by multichromophore fluorescence dequenching.,"Current understanding of virus life-cycle states and transitions between them is mainly built on knowledge of the protein shell structure encapsulating the genome. Little is known about the genome fate during viral transitions. Here, changes in the fluorescence rate from multilabeled transcript viral RNAs encapsulated in Brome mosaic virus capsids were examined as a function of the RNA state. A simple kinetic model relating chain compactness to single-molecule fluorescence emission suggests that in a dense multichromophore system the rate of energy transfer should scale with distance more gradually than the rate of the Förster energy transfer between two chromophores, which varies sharply as the reciprocal of distance to the sixth power. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we have compared predictions from a numerical model for confined diffusive motion with the fluorescence emission from virus-encapsulated and free single RNA molecules decorated with multiple cyanine dyes and encapsulated inside microscopic emulsion droplets. We found that the effective quantum yield per labeled particle depends on the expansion state, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Since fluorescence single particle tracking is now a well-established methodology for the study of virus life cycle, the findings reported here may pave the way toward reducing the existing gap between in vitro and cellular in singulo studies of the fates of viral RNA.",,,"Bromovirus, Capsid, Fluorescence, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Kinetics, Models, Molecular, RNA, Viral",,

MTD simulations explored the free energy surface (FES) of the dye-DNA interactions, which included stacking and major groove binding motifs and unstacked structures. Dynamics of the stacked structures was studied by the MD simulations. All possible combinations of stacking interactions between the two indole rings of the dyes and the neighbor guanine and cytosine rings were observed. The most probable interaction included the stacking between the dye's distal indole ring and the guanine base. In ∼10% of the structures the delocalized π-electrons of the dyes' polymethine linkers played a key role in the dye-DNA dispersion interactions. The stacked conformers of the Cy3 dye were confirmed as true minima by DFT-D full optimizations.

25354708,Near‑infrared fluorescence imaging of prostate cancer using heptamethine carbocyanine dyes.,"Near‑infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging is an attractive novel modality for the detection of cancer. A previous study defined two organic polymethine cyanine dyes as ideal NIRF probes, IR‑783 and its derivative MHI‑148, which have excellent optical characteristics, superior biocompatibility and cancer targeting abilities. To investigate the feasibility of NIRF dye‑mediated prostate cancer imaging, dye uptake and subcellular co‑localization were investigated in PC‑3, DU‑145 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells and RWPE‑1 normal prostate epithelial cells. Different organic anion transporting peptide (OATP) inhibitors were utilized to explore the potential role of the OATP subtype, including the nonspecific OATP inhibitor bromosulfophthalein, the OATP1 inhibitor 17β‑estradiol, the selective OATP1B1 inhibitor rifampicin and the selective OATP1B3 inhibitor cholecystokinin octapeptide. NIRF dyes were also used for the simulated detection of circulating tumor cells and the rapid detection of prostate cancer in human prostate cancer tissues and prostate cancer xenografts in mouse models. The results revealed that the cancer‑specific uptake of these organic dyes in prostate cancer cells occurred primarily via OATP1B3. A strong NIRF signal was detected in prostate cancer tissues, but not in normal tissues that were stained with IR‑783. Prostate cancer cells were recognized with particular NIR fluorescence in isolated mononuclear cell mixtures. The results of the present study demonstrated that NIRF dye‑mediated imaging is a feasible and practicable method for prostate cancer detection, although further investigative studies are required before clinical translation.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Estradiol, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Liver-Specific Organic Anion Transporter 1, Male, Mice, Mice, Nude, Microscopy, Confocal, Neoplastic Cells, Circulating, Organic Anion Transporters, Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent, Organic Cation Transport Proteins, Prostate, Prostatic Neoplasms, Rifampin, Sincalide, Solute Carrier Organic Anion Transporter Family Member 1B3, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Sulfobromophthalein, Transplantation, Heterologous",,
25336944,Covalent IR820-PEG-diamine nanoconjugates for theranostic applications in cancer.,"Near-infrared dyes can be used as theranostic agents in cancer management, based on their optical imaging and localized hyperthermia capabilities. However, their clinical translatability is limited by issues such as photobleaching, short circulation times, and nonspecific biodistribution. Nanoconjugate formulations of cyanine dyes, such as IR820, may be able to overcome some of these limitations. We covalently conjugated IR820 with 6 kDa polyethylene glycol (PEG)-diamine to create a nanoconjugate (IRPDcov) with potential for in vivo applications. The conjugation process resulted in nearly spherical, uniformly distributed nanoparticles of approximately 150 nm diameter and zeta potential -0.4±0.3 mV. The IRPDcov formulation retained the ability to fluoresce and to cause hyperthermia-mediated cell-growth inhibition, with enhanced internalization and significantly enhanced cytotoxic hyperthermia effects in cancer cells compared with free dye. Additionally, IRPDcov demonstrated a significantly longer (P<0.05) plasma half-life, elimination half-life, and area under the curve (AUC) value compared with IR820, indicating larger overall exposure to the theranostic agent in mice. The IRPDcov conjugate had different organ localization than did free IR820, with potential reduced accumulation in the kidneys and significantly lower (P<0.05) accumulation in the lungs. Some potential advantages of IR820-PEG-diamine nanoconjugates may include passive targeting of tumor tissue through the enhanced permeability and retention effect, prolonged circulation times resulting in increased windows for combined diagnosis and therapy, and further opportunities for functionalization, targeting, and customization. The conjugation of PEG-diamine with a near-infrared dye provides a multifunctional delivery vector whose localization can be monitored with noninvasive techniques and that may also serve for guided hyperthermia cancer treatments.",,,"Algorithms, Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Diamines, Humans, Hyperthermia, Induced, Indocyanine Green, Mice, Nanoconjugates, Nanotechnology, Optical Imaging, Polyethylene Glycols, Surgery, Computer-Assisted, Tissue Distribution",,

We review recent advances including our own development of near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) and near-infrared nuclear (NIRN) imaging approaches. We validated our results in experimental models of PCa bone and soft tissue metastases including PCa colonization at metastatic sites by injecting PCa cells either intratibially or intracardiacally. We describe our experience using noninvasive imaging and targeting modalities to probe PCa tumors grown at metastatic sites, molecular studies to understand the multiple molecular and cellular processes within tumor cells and their interactions with the tumor microenvironment, and targeting tumor growth at metastatic bone site. In this review, current knowledge and emerging technologies based on NIRF and NIRN disciplines will be summarized. Additionally the mechanisms of differential uptake of these agents by normal and cancerous cells will be described.",,,,,

26588299,Applications of Time Dependent and Time Independent Density Functional Theory to the First π to π* Transition in Cyanine Dyes.,"The first π → π* transition in a number of cyanine dyes was studied using both time dependent and time independent density functional methods using a coupled cluster (CC2) method as the benchmark scheme. On the basis of 10 different functionals, it was concluded that adiabatic time dependent density functional theory (ATDDFT) almost independently of the functional gives rise to a singlet-triplet separation that is too large by up to 1 eV, leading to too high singlet energies and too low triplet energies. This trend is even clearer when the Tamm-Dancoff (TD) approximation is introduced and can in ATDDFT/TD be traced back to the representation of the singlet-triplet separation by a HF-type exchange integral between π and π*. The time independent DFT methods (ΔSCF and RSCF-CV-DFT) afford triplet energies that are functional independent and close to those obtained by ATDDFT. However, both the singlet energies and the singlet-triplet separations increases with the fraction α of HF exchange. This trend can readily be explained in terms of the modest magnitude of a KS-exchange integral between π and π* in comparison to the much larger HF-exchange integral. It was shown that a fraction α of 0.5 affords good estimates of both the singlet energies and the singlet-triplet separations in comparison to several ab initio benchmarks.",,,,,
25073802,Forcing aggregation of cyanine dyes with salts: a fine line between dimers and higher ordered aggregates.,"It is uncommon to read about cyanine dyes in the literature and not have their aggregation discussed. They are of high interest considering their propensity to undergo self-organization in aqueous solution, leading to interesting photophysical properties resulting from the formation of their dimers and higher ordered aggregates. Currently, the study of their aggregation is in high demand due to their diverse application range including dye-sensitized solar cells. However, their aggregation in high salt solutions is under studied, and the effect on aggregation in congruence with high ionic strength is often overlooked. In a previous study, our group established the role of specific ion effects and in particular the necessity of matching water affinity to induce aggregation of a cationic cyanine dye, thiazole orange. In order to advance the understanding of this topic, we present in this article the diverse aggregation of cyanine dyes, as a single monovalent salt can cause different aggregation responses in a variety of these dyes. We established via absorption spectroscopy combined with chemometric analyses that the inherent monomer-dimer equilibrium of a dye depends on its geometry. More interestingly, experimental data coupled with DFT calculations reveal that not only the geometry of a dye but also its charge location plays a role in the aggregate morphology formed by the interaction of a cationic cyanine dye and an anion. It is thought that contact ion pair formation and effective charge screening generated within that ion pair are responsible for aggregates with a greater order.",,,,,
25018085,Interaction of gold nanoclusters with IR light emitting cyanine dyes: a systematic fluorescence quenching study.,"This paper describes the intermolecular interactions of gold nanoclusters (Au NCs) with cyanine dyes, namely HITC P, DTTC I, and IR 144. All the cyanine dyes quenched the fluorescence of Au NCs effectively. Steady-state and time-resolved measurements were performed to understand the competition between electron transfer and energy transfer in the Au NCs and cyanine dye system. A significant spectral overlap between the emission spectrum of the Au NCs and the absorption spectrum of cyanine dyes was observed, making both ideal for studying FRET interactions. However, after careful inspection of the steady state spectra and time resolved decays we concluded that photoinduced electron transfer (PET) could be the major pathway to quench the fluorescence intensity of Au NCs. To elucidate the interaction mechanism between Au NCs and cyanine dyes, docking studies were also performed. The docking studies reveal that the quencher molecules, i.e. cyanine dyes, come in close proximity with the 34-cysteine (Cys) in BSA where the Au clusters are located to enable the electron transfer process.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Fluorescence, Gold, Infrared Rays, Microscopy, Electron, Transmission, Nanostructures",,

This approach avoids the pitfalls of gel distortions frequently observed in the standard procedure, which hamper the subsequent gel image analysis. Inclusion of an internal standard improves the quantitative evaluation of the protein patterns. Using the advantages of the DIGE approach, impact of minor temperature differences during cold stress treatment could be quantitatively monitored. We will describe the application of DIGE to monitor the impact of cold stress on the proteome pattern of Arabidopsis.

24837360,Interaction of YOYO-3 with different DNA templates to form H-aggregates.,"Homodimeric cyanine dyes are DNA intercalators that display a large enhancement of fluorescence emission when bound to double-stranded DNA. However, other different interaction modes are possible, such as H-type molecular aggregates of the dye, templated by the nucleic acid. In this paper, we study in depth the formation of nonfluorescent H-aggregates of the cyanine homodimer YOYO-3 with two different DNA templates using absorption and both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. First, a nonfluorescent YOYO-3 H-aggregate complex was found to form in single-stranded polycytidine chains, resulting in the appearance of a new absorption band at approximately 500 nm. The specific interaction of cytosine bases suggests the involvement of the C-rich i-motif in facilitating the formation of the H-aggregate complex. Second, the interaction of YOYO-3 with double-stranded poly(A·T) tracts also led to the appearance of a new absorption band at approximately 500 nm, and hence of a different type of H-aggregate. We found that the aggregate is formed mainly in double-stranded regions with consecutive adenine bases in the same strand (and thymine bases in the complementary strand). These poly(A·T) tracts provide narrow minor grooves and enhanced electrostatic negative potential to promote the aggregation of the negatively charged cyanine. As the YOYO-3 H-aggregates are nonfluorescent, our results provide an important basis to quantitatively understand the fluorescence emission of this cyanine dye in the presence of DNA strands.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Oxazoles, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Static Electricity",,
24835334,Expanding the polymethine paradigm: evidence for the contribution of a bis-dipolar electronic structure.,"Although it has been reported in a few instances that the spectroscopic properties of cyanine dyes were strongly dependent on the nature of the chemical substitution of their central carbon atom, there has not been to date any systematic study specifically aimed at rationalizing this behavior. In this article, such a systematic study is carried out on an extended family of 17 polymethine dyes carrying different substituents on their central carbon, some of those being specifically synthesized for this study, some of those similar to previously reported compounds, for the sake of comparison. Their absorption properties, which spread over the whole visible to near-infrared spectral range, are seen to be dramatically dependent on the electron-donating character of this central substituent. By correlating this behavior to NMR spectroscopy and (vibronic) TD-DFT calculations, we show that it results from a profound modification of the ground state electronic configuration, namely, a progressive localization of the cationic charge on the central carbon as the electron-donating nature of the central substituent is increased.",,,,,
24767838,Synthesis and evaluation of new NIR-fluorescent probes for cathepsin B: ICT versus FRET as a turn-ON mode-of-action.,"Recent years have seen tremendous progress in the design and study of molecular imaging geared towards biological and biomedical applications. The expression or activity of specific enzymes including proteases can be monitored by cutting edge molecular imaging techniques. Cathepsin B plays key roles in tumor progression via controlled degradation of extracellular matrix. Consequently, this protease has been attracting significant attention in cancer research, and many imaging probes targeting its activity have been developed. Here, we describe the design, synthesis and evaluation of two novel near infrared (NIR) fluorescent probes for detection of cathepsin B activity with different turn-ON mechanisms. One probe is based on an ICT activation mechanism of a donor-two-acceptor π-electron dye system, while the other is based on the FRET mechanism obtained by a fluorescent dye and a quencher. The two probes exhibit significant fluorescent turn-ON response upon cleavage by cathepsin B. The NIR fluorescence of the ICT probe in its OFF state was significantly lower than that of the FRET-based probe. This effect results in a higher signal-to-noise ratio and consequently increased sensitivity and better image contrast.",,,"Cathepsin B, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Infrared Rays, Molecular Imaging, Molecular Structure",,
24764130,Minimization of self-quenching fluorescence on dyes conjugated to biomolecules with multiple labeling sites via asymmetrically charged NIR fluorophores.,"Self-aggregation of dyes even at low concentrations poses a considerable challenge in preparing sufficiently bright molecular probes for in vivo imaging, particularly in the conjugation of near infrared cyanine dyes to polypeptides with multiple labeling sites. Such self-aggregation leads to a significant energy transfer between the dyes, resulting in severe quenching and low brightness of the targeted probe. To address this problem, we designed a novel type of dye with an asymmetrical distribution of charge. Asymmetrical distribution prevents the chromophores from π-stacking thus minimizing the energy transfer and fluorescence quenching. The conjugation of the dye to polypeptides showed only a small presence of an H-aggregate band in the absorption spectra and, hence, a relatively high quantum efficiency.",,,"Contrast Media, Diagnostic Imaging, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Molecular Probes, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
24737784,Investigation of cyanine dyes for in vivo optical imaging of altered mitochondrial membrane potential in tumors.,"Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm ) alteration is an important target for cancer diagnosis. In this study, we designed a series of near-infrared fluorescent cationic cyanine dyes with varying alkyl chain lengths (IC7-1 derivatives) to provide diverse lipophilicities and serum albumin-binding rates, and we evaluated the usefulness of these derivatives for in vivo Δψm imaging. IC7-1 derivatives with side chains from methyl to hexyl (IC7-1-Me to IC7-1-He) were synthesized, and their optical properties were measured. Cellular uptake and intracellular distribution were investigated with depolarized HeLa cells from carbonyl cyanine m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) treatment using a spectrofluorometer and a fluorescence microscope. Serum albumin-binding rates were evaluated using albumin-binding inhibitors. In vivo optical imaging was performed with HeLa cell xenograft mice following intravenous administration of IC7-1 derivatives with or without warfarin and CCCP as in vivo blocking agents. IC7-1 derivatives showing maximum excitation and emission wavelengths at 823 nm and ~845 nm, respectively, were synthesized. IC7-1-Me to -Bu showed fluorescence in mitochondria that decreased with CCCP treatment in a concentration-dependent manner, which showed that IC7-1-Me to -Bu successfully indicated Δψm . Tumors were clearly visualized after IC7-1-Bu administration. Treatment with warfarin or CCCP significantly decreased IC7-1-Bu fluorescence in the tumor region. In summary, IC7-1-Bu exhibited fluorescence localized to mitochondria dependent on Δψm , which enabled clear in vivo tumor imaging via serum albumin as a drug carrier for effective tumor targeting. Our data suggest that IC7-1-Bu is a promising NIR probe for in vivo imaging of the altered Δψm of tumor cells.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, HeLa Cells, Humans, Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Neoplasm Transplantation, Optical Imaging, Protein Binding",,
26580191,Fast and Accurate Electronic Excitations in Cyanines with the Many-Body Bethe-Salpeter Approach.,"The accurate prediction of the optical signatures of cyanine derivatives remains an important challenge in theoretical chemistry. Indeed, up to now, only the most expensive quantum chemical methods (CAS-PT2, CC, DMC, etc.) yield consistent and accurate data, impeding the applications on real-life molecules. Here, we investigate the lowest lying singlet excitation energies of increasingly long cyanine dyes within the GW and Bethe-Salpeter Green's function many-body perturbation theory. Our results are in remarkable agreement with available coupled-cluster (exCC3) data, bringing these two single-reference perturbation techniques within a 0.05 eV maximum discrepancy. By comparison, available TD-DFT calculations with various semilocal, global, or range-separated hybrid functionals, overshoot the transition energies by a typical error of 0.3-0.6 eV. The obtained accuracy is achieved with a parameter-free formalism that offers similar accuracy for metallic or insulating, finite size or extended systems.",,,,,

Previous research has shown that the fluorescence efficiency of Cy3 and Cy5, covalently attached to the 5' end of single-stranded DNA, is strongly sequence dependent. Here, we show that DY547 and DY647, two alternative cyanine dyes that are becoming widely used for nucleic acid labeling, have a similar pattern of sequence-dependence, with adjacent purines resulting in higher intensity and adjacent cytosines resulting in lower intensity. Investigated over the range of all 1024 possible DNA 5mers, the intensities of Cy3 and Cy5 drop by ∼ 50% and ∼ 65% with respect to their maxima, respectively, whereas the intensities of DY547 and DY647 fall by ∼ 45% and ∼ 40%, respectively. The reduced magnitude of change of the fluorescence intensity of the DyLight dyes, particularly of DY647 in comparison with Cy5, suggests that these dyes are less likely to introduce sequence-dependent bias into experiments based on fluorescent labeling of nucleic acids.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, DNA, Single-Stranded, Fluorescence, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence",,
24376142,Increasing the brightness of cyanine fluorophores for single-molecule and superresolution imaging.,"In spite of their relatively low fluorescence quantum yield, cyanine dyes such as Cy3, Cy5, or Cy7 are widely used in single-molecule fluorescence applications due to their high extinction coefficients and excellent photon yields. We show that the fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime of red-emitting cyanine dyes can be substantially increased in heavy water (D2 O) compared with water (H2 O). We find that the magnitude of the quantum yield increase in D2 O scales with the emission wavelength, reaching a particularly high value of 2.6-fold for the most red-emitting dye investigated, Cy7. We further demonstrate a higher photon yield in single-molecule superresolution experiments in D2 O compared to H2 O, which leads to an improved localization precision and hence better spatial resolution. This finding is especially beneficial for biological applications of fluorescence microscopy, which are typically carried out in aqueous media and which greatly profit from the red spectral range due to reduced cellular auto-fluorescence.",,,,,
24284102,Cyanines in photodynamic reaction assisted by reversible electroporation--in vitro study on human breast carcinoma cells.,"Ineffective drug delivery is a vast problem of anticancer therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate the possibility of enhancement of cyanines transport through the cell membrane by electroporation and to evaluate a photodynamic activity of these compounds. We evaluated in vitro the effectiveness of photodynamic reaction with cyanines on breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7/WT) and normal Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) lacking voltage-dependent ion channels, alone and combined with electropermeabilization. Among six cyanines tested, two compounds could be indicated as good therapeutic candidates: IR-775 and IR-786. Cellular effects were assessed with MTT assay reporting cell mitochondrial activity and with SRB assay based on the measurement of cellular protein content. Cyanines localization was observed with confocal microscope. Photodynamic reaction of MCF-7/WT cells with IR-775 and IR-786 did not result in cellular dysfunction. Electric field intensities and pulse duration, non-toxic for cells, significantly increased photocytotoxicity of the cyanines after electropermeabilization with IR-775 and IR-786. Much shorter exposure times were efficient for cyanines in photodynamic reaction assisted by electroporation (10 min instead of 24h). Our results indicate that electroporation of cancerous cells in the presence of cyanine dyes could increase the uptake of the photosensitizer, which correlates with a higher cytotoxicity in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line. Electroporation may be an attractive delivery system for photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy, enabling application of new compounds and reduction of drug dose and exposure time.",,,"Animals, Apoptosis, Breast Neoplasms, CHO Cells, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cricetinae, Cricetulus, Electroporation, Female, Humans, Photosensitizing Agents",,
24258004,Study on the Synthesis and Spectra of a Novel Kind of Carbozole Benzothiazole Indole Styryl Cyanine Dye with a Carbazole Bridged Chain.,"Based on the frequently-used cyanine dye probe thiazole orange (TO) and Cy3, a novel kind of styryl cyanine dye was designed and synthesized. Carbazole was inserted into the structures of two cyanine dyes, TO and Cy3, to act as a bridge to link the benzothiazole and indole. This modification resulted in a novel kind of carbozole benzothiazole indole cyanine dye with a carbazole-bridged chain. The dyes were characterized by HNMR and MS. The spectra of the novel dyes were also studied and the results showed that the fluorescence wavelength of novel carbazole benzothiazole indole cyanine dye shifted red, the Stokes shift and Fluorescence quantum yields increased and the fluorescence intensity was enhanced compared to that of TO. These results indicated that the novel dye could be used as an excellent fluorescent probe in biological labeling.",,,"Carbazoles, Coloring Agents, Solvents, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

24231377,New fluorogenic dyes for analysis of cellular processes by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy.,"Fluorescent microscopy and fluorescent imaging by flow cytometry are two of the fastest growing areas in the medical and biological research. Innovations in fluorescent chemistry and synthesis of new dye probes are closely related to the development of service equipment such as light sources, and detection techniques. Among compounds known as fluorescent labels, the cyanine-based dyes have become widely used since they have high excitation coefficients, narrow emission bands and high fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acids. The key methods for evaluation of apoptosis and cell cycle allow measuring DNA content by several flow cytometric techniques. We have synthesized new monomethine cyanine dyes and have characterized their applicability for staining of live and/or apoptotic cells. Imaging experiments by flow cytometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) have been also performed. Two of the dyes have shown high-affinity binding to the nuclei at high dilutions, up to 10(-9)M. Flow cytometry and CLSM have confirmed that these dyes labeled selectively non-living, e.g. ethanol-fixed cells that makes them appropriate for estimations of cell viability and apoptosis. The novel structures proved to be appropriate also for analysis of the cell cycle.",,,"3T3 Cells, Animals, Apoptosis, Carbocyanines, Cell Survival, Cells, Cultured, Female, Flow Cytometry, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Microscopy, Confocal, Spleen",,
26583416,Longest-Wavelength Electronic Excitations of Linear Cyanines: The Role of Electron Delocalization and of Approximations in Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory.,"The lowest-energy/longest-wavelength electronic singlet excitation energies of linear cyanine dyes are examined, using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and selected wave function methods in comparison with literature data. Variations of the bond-length alternation obtained with different optimized structures produce small differences of the excitation energy in the limit of an infinite chain. Hybrid functionals with range-separated exchange are optimally 'tuned', which is shown to minimize the delocalization error (DE) in the cyanine π systems. Much unlike the case of charge-transfer excitations, small DEs are not strongly correlated with better performance. A representative cyanine is analyzed in detail. Compared with accurate benchmark data, TDDFT with 'pure' local functionals gives too high singlet excitation energies for all systems, but DFT-based ΔSCF calculations with a local functional severely underestimates the energies. TDDFT strongly overestimates the difference between singlet and triplet excitation energies. An analysis points to systematically much too small magnitudes of integrals from the DFT components of the exchange-correlation response kernel as the likely culprit. The findings support previous suggestions that the differential correlation energy between the ground and excited state is not correctly produced by TDDFT with most functionals.",,,,,
24150231,All-near-infrared multiphoton microscopy interrogates intact tissues at deeper imaging depths than conventional single- and two-photon near-infrared excitation microscopes.,"The era of molecular medicine has ushered in the development of microscopic methods that can report molecular processes in thick tissues with high spatial resolution. A commonality in deep-tissue microscopy is the use of near-infrared (NIR) lasers with single- or multiphoton excitations. However, the relationship between different NIR excitation microscopic techniques and the imaging depths in tissue has not been established. We compared such depth limits for three NIR excitation techniques: NIR single-photon confocal microscopy (NIR SPCM), NIR multiphoton excitation with visible detection (NIR/VIS MPM), and all-NIR multiphoton excitation with NIR detection (NIR/NIR MPM). Homologous cyanine dyes provided the fluorescence. Intact kidneys were harvested after administration of kidney-clearing cyanine dyes in mice. NIR SPCM and NIR/VIS MPM achieved similar maximum imaging depth of ∼100 μm. The NIR/NIR MPM enabled greater than fivefold imaging depth (>500 μm) using the harvested kidneys. Although the NIR/NIR MPM used 1550-nm excitation where water absorption is relatively high, cell viability and histology studies demonstrate that the laser did not induce photothermal damage at the low laser powers used for the kidney imaging. This study provides guidance on the imaging depth capabilities of NIR excitation-based microscopic techniques and reveals the potential to multiplex information using these platforms.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Survival, Contrast Media, Emulsions, Fluorescent Dyes, Histocytochemistry, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Kidney, Lasers, Male, Mice, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton, Phantoms, Imaging, Phospholipids, Soybean Oil, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
24129400,Cationic cyanine dyes: impact of symmetry-breaking on optical absorption and third-order polarizabilities.,"A systematic study is carried out to find the exact crossover point from symmetric to asymmetric configurations (symmetry-breaking) in a series of cationic cyanine dyes. Hybrid density functional with varying exact-exchange admixture has been used to understand the impact of HF exchange both in the gas phase and in the presence of dielectric medium. This approach provides a basis for understanding the electronic structure and photophysical properties of cyanine dyes. The crossover points predicted using this method are in good agreement with the experiment. The SAC-CI method is used to evaluate the lowest S0 → S1 transition energies in the gas phase. These transitions are preferably dominated by the promotion of an electron from HOMO → LUMO. The average static third-order polarizabilities, [γ], are obtained within the three-state model approximation. The analysis showed that for symmetric cyanines, the calculated [γ] values are large and negative, mainly originated from the large S0 → S1 transition moments and small S0 → S1 transition energies. For asymmetric cyanines, the [γ] values are positive and mainly originate from the large change in the ground and first excited state dipole moments. However, both configurations do not include contributions from the two-photon absorption. Further, the localization of charge densities in the HOMO and LUMO indicates that the symmetric and asymmetric cyanines act as promising materials for molecular wires and molecular switches which are fundamental building blocks for molecular electronic devices.",,,,,
24111914,Vibrational energy flow between modes by dynamic mode coupling in THIATS J-aggregates.,"We performed ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy of J-aggregates of 3,3'-disulfopropyl-5,5'-dichloro-9-ethyl thiacarbocyanine triethylammonium (THIATS), one of the most typical cyanine dyes, and detected excited molecular vibrations, using a sub-10 fs pulse laser. The time-resolved two-dimensional difference absorption (ΔA) spectra are observed between -314 and 1267 fs. By performing the Fourier transform and spectrogram analysis, vibrational modes in THIATS are observed at 285, 485, 555, 824, and 1633 cm(-1) and there was a modulation of the vibrational frequencies around 1633 cm(-1) which depend on the delay time, respectively. By the analysis of the modulation, energy flow is found to take place from other modes to the 1633 cm(-1) mode through the low frequency mode with ∼50 cm(-1). Also, by fitting the real-time traces of ΔA with the sum of two exponential functions and a constant term, the average lifetimes of three electronically excited states were found to be τ1 = 52 ± 5 fs and τ2 = 540 ± 78 fs. By performing single-exponential fitting around the stationary absorption peak at 1.990 eV, in the negative time range, the electronic dephasing time, T2(ele), is determined to be 18.30 fs.",,,,,

Nanoparticle-based ""light switches"" for measuring protease activity consist of fluorescent cyanine dyes and porphyrins that are attached to Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticles via consensus sequences. These consensus sequences can be cleaved in the presence of the correct protease, thus releasing a fluorescent dye from the Fe/Fe3O4 nanoparticle, resulting in highly sensitive (down to 1 × 10(-16) mol l(-1) for 12 proteases), selective, and fast nanoplatforms (required time: 60 min).",,,"Calibration, Carbocyanines, Consensus Sequence, Enzyme Assays, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Magnetite Nanoparticles, Matrix Metalloproteinase 13, Nanotechnology, Neoplasms, Peptide Hydrolases, Porphyrins, Reproducibility of Results, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Surface Properties",,

This results in increased photobleaching and triplet blinking. Experiments with other divalent ions and paramagnetic molecules suggest that the enhancement in the intersystem-crossing rate is related to the paramagnetic nature of the Mn(2+) cation. The results are consistent with a model in which the formation of a weak collisional complex between the dye and the ion results in mixing of the singlet and triplet states of the dye.

24019855,Comparative tumor imaging and PDT Efficacy of HPPH conjugated in the mono- and di-forms to various polymethine cyanine dyes: part - 2.,"Previous reports from our laboratory have shown that a bifunctional agent obtained by conjugating a photosensitizer (HPPH) to a cyanine dye (CD) can be used for fluorescence image-guided treatment of tumor by photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the resulting HPPH-CD conjugate showed a significant difference between the tumor-imaging and therapeutic doses. It was demonstrated that the singlet oxygen ( (1) O 2 (*), a key cytotoxic agent in PDT) produced by the conjugate upon excitation of the HPPH moiety was partially quenched by the CD-moiety; this resulted in a reduced PDT response when compared to HPPH-PDT under similar treatment parameters. To improve the therapeutic potential of the conjugate, we synthesized a series of dual functional agents in which one or two HPPH moieties were separately conjugated to three different dyes (Cypate, modified IR820 or modified IR783). The newly synthesized conjugates were compared with our lead compound HPPH-CD in terms of photophysical properties, in vitro and in vivo PDT efficacy, tumor uptake and imaging potential. Among the analogs investigated, the conjugate, in which two HPPH moieties were linked to the modified IR820 produced enhanced tumor uptake and tumor contrast in both Colon 26 (a murine Colon carcinoma) and U87 (a human glioblastoma) cell lines. The long-term PDT efficacy (cure) of this conjugate in BALB/c mice, bearing Colon 26 tumors was also enhanced; however, its efficacy in Nude mice bearing U87 tumors was slightly reduced. It was also found that in all the conjugates the singlet oxygen generation and, consequently, PDT efficacy were compromised by a competing pathway, whereby an electronic excitation of HPPH, the energy donor, is deactivated through an electronic excitation energy transfer (Forster Resonance Energy Transfer, FRET) to the CD fluorophore, the energy acceptor, resulting in overall reduction of the singlet oxygen production. Conjugates with increased FRET showed reduced singlet oxygen production and PDT efficacy. Among the conjugates investigated, the bifunctional agent in which two HPPH moieties were linked to the benzoindole-based cyanine dye 11 showed superiority over the lead candidate 9 (mono HPPH-cyanine dye).",,,"Animals, Chlorophyll, Disease Models, Animal, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indoles, Mice, Nude, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Pathology, Clinical, Photochemotherapy, Staining and Labeling",,
24019854,Evaluation of polymethine dyes as potential probes for near infrared fluorescence imaging of tumors: part - 1.,"Near-infrared (NIR) organic dyes have become important for many biomedical applications, including in vivo optical imaging. Conjugation of NIR fluorescent dyes to photosensitizing molecules (photosensitizers) holds strong potential for NIR fluorescence image guided photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer. Therefore, we were interested in investigating the photophysical properties, in vivo tumor-affinity and fluorescence imaging potential of a series of heterocyclic polymethine dyes, which could then be conjugated to certain PDT agents. For our present study, we selected a series of symmetrical polymethine dyes containing a variety of bis-N-substituted indole or benzindole moieties linked by linear conjugation with and without a fused substituted cyclohexene ring. The N-alkyl side chain at the C-terminal position was functionalized with sulfonic, carboxylic acid, methyl ester or hydroxyl groups. Although, among the parent cyanine dyes investigated, the commercially available, cyanine dye IR783 (3) (bis-indole-N-butylsulfonate)-polymethine dye with a cyclic chloro-cyclohexene moiety showed best fluorescence-imaging ability, based on its spectral properties (λAbs=782 nm, λFl=810 nm, ε = 261,000 M(-1)cm(-1), ΦFl≈0.08) and tumor affinity. In addition to 3, parent dyes IR820 and Cypate (6) were also selected and subjected to further modifications by introducing desired functional groups, which could enable further conjugation of the cyanine dyes to an effective photosensitizer HPPH developed in our laboratory. The synthesis and biological studies (tumor-imaging and PDT) of the resulting bifunctional conjugates are discussed in succeeding paper (Part-2 of this study).",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Indoles, Neoplasms, Optical Imaging, Pathology, Clinical, Staining and Labeling",,

The optical properties of dendrite structures with fractal dimension 1.7-1.8, formed from J-aggregates integrated with CdTe quantum dots (QDs), have been investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Our results demonstrate that (i) J-aggregates are coupled to QDs by Förster-type resonant energy transfer and (ii) there are energy fluxes from the periphery to the centre of the structure, where the QD density is higher than in the periphery of the dendrite. Such an anisotropic energy transport can be only observed when dendrites are formed from QDs integrated with J-aggregates. These QD/J-aggregate hybrid systems can have applications in light harvesting systems and optical sensors with extended absorption spectra.",,,,,
23946103,Photochemical properties of squarylium cyanine dyes.,"This study presents several new squarylium dyes derived from benzothiazole and benzoselenazole with several structural variations, namely the nature of the heteroaromatic ring and the length of the N,N'-dialkyl groups. Before being investigated in connection with their effect on living cells and/or tissues, these novel compounds were characterized, namely with respect to the determination of their main photophysical parameters. Therefore, a study of the ground state absorption, fluorescence emission (quantum yields and lifetimes) and singlet oxygen generation quantum yields was performed for all the compounds synthesized in order to evaluate their efficiency as photosensitizers. An increase of the alkyl chain length from ethyl to hexyl did not produce a clear change in the fluorescence quantum yields, showing no influence on the photoisomerization process. Heavy atom inclusion (Se instead of S) enhanced the singlet oxygen generation efficiency and decreased the intensity of the fluorescence emission. The external heavy atom effect (I(-) as a counterion instead of CF3SO3(-)) produced a significant increase in the singlet oxygen formation quantum yield (about 20%). Transient absorption studies in aerated and oxygen free samples revealed that the photoisomerization process, which could compete with the triplet state formation for all dyes in solution, is a negligible pathway for the excited state deactivation, in accordance with the rigidity introduced by the squaric ring into the polymethine chain of the dye, both in chloroform and ethanol. However, in the case of the chloroform solution a new transient was detected in air equilibrated solutions, resulting from a reaction of the excited squarylium dye in the singlet state with CHCl3˙, and assigned to the radical cation (SQ(+)˙) of the dye.",,,,,
23873377,Protein purification by aminosquarylium cyanine dye-affinity chromatography.,"The most selective purification method for proteins and other biomolecules is affinity chromatography. This method is based on the unique biological-based specificity of the biomolecule-ligand interaction and commonly uses biological ligands. However, these ligands may present some drawbacks, mainly because of their cost and lability. Dye-affinity chromatography overcomes the limitations of biological ligands and is widely used owing to the low cost of synthetic dyes and to their resistance to biological and chemical degradation. In this work, immobilized aminosquarylium cyanine dyes are used in order to exploit affinity interactions with standard proteins such as lysozyme, α-chymotrypsin and trypsin. These studies evaluate the affinity interactions occurring between the immobilized ligand and the different proteins, as a reflection of the sum of several molecular interactions, namely ionic, hydrophobic and van der Waals, spread throughout the structure, in a defined spatial manner. The results show the possibility of using an aminosquarylium cyanine dye bearing a N-hexyl pendant chain, with a ligand density of 1.8 × 10(-2) mmol of dye/g of chromatographic support, to isolate lysozyme, α-chymotrypsin and trypsin from a mixture. The application of a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient resulted in the recovery of lysozyme in the flowthrough. On the other hand, α-chymotrypsin and trypsin were retained, involving different interactions with the ligand. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the potential applicability of ligands such as aminosquarylium cyanine dyes for the separation and purification of proteins by affinity chromatography.",,,"Carbocyanines, Chromatography, Affinity, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Fluorescent Dyes, Ligands, Proteins",,
23822175,Dye sensitization of four low index TiO2 single crystal photoelectrodes with a series of dicarboxylated cyanine dyes.,"Four dicarboxylated cyanine dyes were used to sensitize single-crystal anatase (001), anatase (101), rutile (001), and rutile (100) surfaces. Incident photon to current efficiencies (IPCE) spectra and isotherms were gathered for the different combination of dyes and surfaces. The maximum coverage of the surface-bound dyes on the TiO2 crystal surfaces was determined by photochronocoulometric measurements. The IPCE spectra of the surface-bound dyes revealed that both the dye monomers and H-aggregates were both present and generated photocurrent. The relative abundance of dye monomers and H-aggregates was found to be strongly dependent on the crystallographic face used as the substrate for sensitization. The ratio of dye monomer to H-aggregate was quantified by fitting the IPCE spectra with a sum of the dye monomer and H-aggregate solution spectra. The trends in surface coverage were explained using a simple ""lattice matching"" model where the distance between the coordinatively unsaturated Ti binding sites on the various TiO2 crystallographic surfaces was compared with the distance between the carboxylate groups on the dyes. The rutile (100) surface had the highest coverage for all the dyes in agreement with the predictions of the lattice-matching model. Absorbed photon-to-current-efficiencies (APCEs) were calculated from the incident photon current efficiencies, the extinction coefficients and the measured surface coverages. The factors that affect the APCE values such as the relative injection yield for monomers and aggregate, the relative surface coverage values for monomers and aggregates, and semiconductor doping levels are discussed.",,,,,
23799279,Indocyanine dyes approach free rotation at the 3' terminus of A-RNA: a comparison with the 5' terminus and consequences for fluorescence resonance energy transfer.,"Cyanine dyes are widely used to study the folding and structural transformations of nucleic acids using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The extent to which FRET can be used to extract inter- and intramolecular distances has been the subject of considerable debate in the literature; the contribution of dye and linker dynamics to the observed FRET signal is particularly troublesome. We used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the dynamics of the indocarbocyanine dyes Cy3 and Cy5 attached variously to the 3' or 5' terminal bases of a 16-base-pair RNA duplex. We then used Monte Carlo modeling of dye photophysics to predict the results of single-molecule-sensitive FRET measurements of these same molecules. Our results show that the average value of FRET depends on both the terminal base and the linker position. In particular, 3' attached dyes typically explore a wide region of configuration space, and the relative orientation factor, κ(2), has a distribution that approaches that of free-rotators. This is in contrast to 5' attached dyes, which spend a significant fraction of their time in one or more configurations that are effectively stacked on the ends of the RNA duplex. The presence of distinct dye configurations for 5' attached dyes is consistent with observations, made by others, of multiple fluorescence lifetimes of Cy3 on nucleic acids. Although FRET is frequently used as a molecular ""ruler"" to measure intramolecular distances, the unambiguous measurement of distances typically relies on the assumption that the rotational degrees of freedom of the dyes can be averaged out and that the donor lifetime in the absence of the acceptor is a constant. We demonstrate that even for the relatively free 3' attached dyes, the correlation time of κ(2) is still too long to justify the use of a free-rotation approximation. We further explore the consequences of multiple donor lifetimes on the predicted value of FRET.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Molecular Dynamics Simulation, RNA",,
23788404,Cyanine-like dyes with large bond-length alternation.,"Herein, the synthesis and properties of alkyne-bridged carbocations, which are analogous in structure to cyanine dyes, are reported. An alkene-bridged dye, linked at the third position of the indole, was also synthesized as a reference compound. These new carbocations are stable under ambient conditions, allowing characterization by UV/Vis and NMR ((1)H and (13)C) spectroscopies. These techniques revealed a large degree of delocalization of the positive charge, similar to a previously reported porphyrin carbocation. The linear and nonlinear optical properties are compared with cyanine dyes and triarylmethyl cations, to investigate the effects of the bond-length alternation and the overall molecular geometry. The value of Re(γ), the real part of the third-order microscopic polarizability, of -1.3×10(-33)  esu for the alkyne-linked cation is comparable to that of a cyanine dye of similar length. Nondegenerate two-photon absorption spectra showed that the alkene-bridged dye exhibited characteristics of cyanines, whereas the alkyne-bridged dye is reminiscent of octupolar chromophores, such as the triarylmethyl carbocation brilliant green. Such attributes were confirmed and rationalized by quantum chemical calculations.",,,"Alkynes, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Indoles, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Molecular Structure",,

Serum samples from 20 male HCM patients and their sex- and age-matched controls were cleaned from interfering components. Patients and controls were pooled in five matched groups with the same age, and proteins extracts from each pool were labelled with cyanine dyes. Then, gel images were analysed using a fluorescence scanner and proteins were identified. Tryptic peptides were analysed by capillary reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled online with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). Four different proteins were observed to be differentially expressed between HCM patients and their matched controls. Of them, decreases in haptoglobin levels were confirmed to be associated with HCM in an independent set of 181 consecutive HCM patients from our monographic clinic and 114 controls with similar age and sex using a nephelometer-based technique. Moreover, a significant negative correlation was observed between haptoglobin and subaortic gradient, thus highlighting the role of haptoglobin in HCM.

An ultrafast fluorescence study.,"The electronic relaxation dynamics of the second singlet excited states of several cyanine dyes was studied through the femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion technique. Our interest in these molecules comes from the potential applications of systems with upper excited singlet states with a long lifetime, which can include electron and energy transfer from the higher lying singlets after one- or two-photon absorption. We studied three series of cyanines with 4-quinolyl, 2-quinolyl, or benzothiazolyl type end groups, each with varying sp(2) carbon conjugation lengths in the methinic bridge. The dynamics after electronic excitation to singlet states above the fluorescent state vary significantly as a function of cyanine structure and conjugation length. In particular, for the 4-quinolyl series the cyanine with an intermediate conjugation length (three methinic carbons) has the slowest S2 decays with lifetimes of 5.4 ps in ethanol and 6.6 ps in ethylene glycol. On the other hand, we observed that the 2-quinolyl family has S2 decay times in the subpicosecond range independent of the conjugation length between the end groups. The slowest internal conversion was observed for the benzothiazolyl type cyanine with five methinic carbons, with an S2 lifetime of 17.3 ps in ethanol. For the planar cyanines of this study we observed for the first time a clear systematic trend in the S2 decay times which closely follow the energy gap law. It was also demonstrated that a slow S2 decay is as well observed upon excitation through degenerate two-photon absorption with near-IR pulses.

23461650,Vibronic and vibrational coherences in two-dimensional electronic spectra of supramolecular J-aggregates.,"In J-aggregates of cyanine dyes, closely packed molecules form mesoscopic tubes with nanometer-diameter and micrometer-length. Their efficient energy transfer pathways make them suitable candidates for artificial light harvesting systems. This great potential calls for an in-depth spectroscopic analysis of the underlying energy deactivation network and coherence dynamics. We use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy with sub-10 fs laser pulses in combination with two-dimensional decay-associated spectra analysis to describe the population flow within the aggregate. Based on the analysis of Fourier-transform amplitude maps, we distinguish between vibrational or vibronic coherence dynamics as the origin of pronounced oscillations in our two-dimensional electronic spectra.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Electrons, Entropy, Fourier Analysis, Models, Molecular, Molecular Conformation, Polymers, Spectrum Analysis, Vibration, Water",,
23452006,"Simple design for DNA nanotubes from a minimal set of unmodified strands: rapid, room-temperature assembly and readily tunable structure.","DNA nanotubes have great potential as nanoscale scaffolds for the organization of materials and the templation of nanowires and as drug delivery vehicles. Current methods for making DNA nanotubes either rely on a tile-based step-growth polymerization mechanism or use a large number of component strands and long annealing times. Step-growth polymerization gives little control over length, is sensitive to stoichiometry, and is slow to generate long products. Here, we present a design strategy for DNA nanotubes that uses an alternative, more controlled growth mechanism, while using just five unmodified component strands and a long enzymatically produced backbone. These tubes form rapidly at room temperature and have numerous, orthogonal sites available for the programmable incorporation of arrays of cargo along their length. As a proof-of-concept, cyanine dyes were organized into two distinct patterns by inclusion into these DNA nanotubes.",,,"Crystallization, DNA, Macromolecular Substances, Materials Testing, Molecular Conformation, Nanocapsules, Nanotubes, Particle Size, Porosity, Surface Properties, Temperature",,

Upon reaction with NTR, the nitro-group of p-nitrobenzyl moiety was reduced to amino-group and therefore renews the π-electron conjugation of the dye, resulting in the intense NIR fluorescent emission (708 nm). This redox-induced NIR-fluorescence probe has been successfully applied to the detection of NTR activity under physiological conditions with high selectivity.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, Kinetics, Nitroreductases, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
23415397,Novel fluorescent dyes for single DNA molecule techniques.,"To answer the demands of scientific and medical imaging issues, the family of nucleic acid fluorescent dyes is constantly enlarging. Most of the developed dyes reveal high qualities in bulk solution assays but are inefficient to produce a strong and sufficiently stable signal to enable the application of single-molecule techniques. Therefore, we tested 12 novel monomeric and homodimeric cyanine dyes for potential single DNA molecule imaging. Although their qualities in bulk solutions have already been described, nothing was known about their behavior on a single-molecule level. All 12 dyes demonstrated strong emission when intercalated into single DNA molecules and stretched on a silanized surface, which makes them the perfect choice for fluorescent microscopy imaging. A comparison of their fluorescence intensity and photostability with the most applicable dyes in single-molecule techniques, fluorescent dyes YOYO-1 and POPO-3, was carried out. They all exhibited a strong signal, comparable to that of YOYO-1. However, in contrast to YOYO-1, which is visualized under a green filter only, their emission permits red filter visualization. As their photostability highly exceeds that of similar spectrum POPO-3 dye, the studied dyes stand out as the best choice for a broad range of solid surface single-molecule applications when yellow to red DNA backbone fluorescence is needed.",,,"Benzoxazoles, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Imaging, Quinolinium Compounds",,

Using Cy5 as a model, we show that the quenching reaction occurs by 1,4-addition of the phosphine to the polymethine bridge of Cy5 to form a covalent adduct. Illumination with UV light dissociates the adduct and returns the dye to the fluorescent state.

These dyes were equipped with various reactive and/or bioconjugatable groups (azido, α-iodoacetyl, ketone, terminal alkyne, vicinal diol). The azido derivative was found to be highly reactive in the context of copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reactions and allowed easy synthetic access to the first water-soluble (sulfonated derivative) and aldehyde-modified BHQ-3 dyes, the direct preparation of which failed by means of conventional azo-coupling reactions. The aldehyde- and α-iodoacetyl-containing fluorescence quenchers were readily conjugated to aminooxy- and cysteine-containing peptides by the formation of a stable oxime or thioether linkage, respectively. Further fluorescent labeling of the resultant peptide conjugates with red- or far-red-emitting rhodamine or cyanine dyes through sequential and/or one-pot bioconjugations, led to novel Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) based probes suitable for the in vivo detection and imaging of urokinase plasminogen activator, a key protease in cancer invasion and metastasis.",,,"Azo Compounds, Catalysis, Coloring Agents, Cyclization, Diagnostic Imaging, Enzyme Activation, Fluorescent Dyes, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Oximes, Peptide Hydrolases, Rhodamines, Sulfonic Acids",,

The recent designing and synthetic efforts have been dedicated to improving their optical properties (shift the absorption and emission maxima toward longer wavelengths and increase the brightness) as well as increasing their stability and water solubility. The most notable advances include development of encapsulated cyanine dyes with increased stability and water solubility, squaraine rotaxanes with increased stability, long-wavelength-absorbing boron dipyrromethenes, long-wavelength-absorbing porphyrin and hydroporphyrin derivatives, and water-soluble phthalocyanines.

The photovoltaic performance of these solar cells depends markedly on the molecular structure of the dyes in terms of the n-hexyl chains and the methoxyl unit. Retardation of charge recombination caused by the introduction of n-hexyl chains resulted in an increase in electron lifetime. As a consequence, an improvement of open-circuit photovoltage (V(oc)) was achieved. Also, the electron injection efficiencies were improved by the introduction of methoxyl moiety, which led to a higher short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)). The highest average efficiency of the sensitized devices (η) was 5.6% (J(sc)=13.3 mA cm(-2), V(oc)=606 mV, and fill factor FF=69.1%) under 100 mW cm(-2) (AM 1.5G) solar irradiation. All of these dyes have very high absorption extinction coefficients and strong absorption in a relatively narrow spectrum range (500-650 nm), so one of our organic dyes was explored as a sensitizer in co-sensitized solar cells in combination with the other two other existing organic dyes. Interestingly, a considerably improved photovoltaic performance of 8.2% (J(sc)=20.1 mA cm(-2), V(oc)=597 mV, and FF=68.3%) was achieved and the device showed a panchromatic response with a high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency exceeding 85% in the range of 400-700 nm.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Dielectric Spectroscopy, Electric Power Supplies, Solar Energy",,
23180379,Interfacing click chemistry with automated oligonucleotide synthesis for the preparation of fluorescent DNA probes containing internal xanthene and cyanine dyes.,"Double-labeled oligonucleotide probes containing fluorophores interacting by energy-transfer mechanisms are essential for modern bioanalysis, molecular diagnostics, and in vivo imaging techniques. Although bright xanthene and cyanine dyes are gaining increased prominence within these fields, little attention has thus far been paid to probes containing these dyes internally attached, a fact which is mainly due to the quite challenging synthesis of such oligonucleotide probes. Herein, by using 2'-O-propargyl uridine phosphoramidite and a series of xanthenes and cyanine azide derivatives, we have for the first time performed solid-phase copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) click labeling during the automated phosphoramidite oligonucleotide synthesis followed by postsynthetic click reactions in solution. We demonstrate that our novel strategy is rapid and efficient for the preparation of novel oligonucleotide probes containing internally positioned xanthene and cyanine dye pairs and thus represents a significant step forward for the preparation of advanced fluorescent oligonucleotide probes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the novel xanthene and cyanine labeled probes display unusual and very promising photophysical properties resulting from energy-transfer interactions between the fluorophores controlled by nucleic acid assembly. Potential benefits of using these novel fluorescent probes within, for example, molecular diagnostics and fluorescence microscopy include: Considerable Stokes shifts (40-110 nm), quenched fluorescence of single-stranded probes accompanied by up to 7.7-fold light-up effect of emission upon target DNA/RNA binding, remarkable sensitivity to single-nucleotide mismatches, generally high fluorescence brightness values (FB up to 26), and hence low limit of target detection values (LOD down to <5 nM).",,,"Alkynes, Azides, Carbocyanines, Catalysis, Click Chemistry, Coloring Agents, Copper, Cyclization, DNA, DNA Probes, Fluorescence, Oligonucleotides, Xanthenes",,

The difference between these two compounds is the type of N-substitution on the quinolinium ring system (SYBR Safe, n-Pr; thiazole orange, Me). The (1)H and (13)C NMR resonances for both compounds were assigned on the basis of one- and two-dimensional (COSY, ROESY, HSQC, and HMBC) experiments.

23127491,Halogenated pentamethine cyanine dyes exhibiting high fidelity for G-quadruplex DNA.,"Design and optimization of quadruplex-specific small molecules is developing into an attractive strategy for anti-cancer therapeutics with some promising candidates in clinical trials. A number of therapeutically favorable features of cyanine molecules can be effectively exploited to develop them as promising quadruplex-targeting agents. Herein, the design, synthesis and evaluation of a series of dimethylindolenine cyanine dyes with varying halogen substitutions are reported. Their interactions with telomeric and c-myc quadruplexes as well as a reference duplex sequence have been evaluated using thermal melting, biosensor-surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry and mass spectrometry. Thermal melting analysis indicates that these ligands exhibit significant quadruplex stabilization and a very low duplex binding, with the dimethyl incorporation of paramount importance for decreased duplex affinity. Circular dichroism studies showed that the interaction of cyanines with quadruplex structures are primarily through stacking at one or both ends of the terminal tetrads with the two (trimethylammonium)propyl groups interacting in the accessible quadruplex grooves. Surface plasmon resonance and mass spectral studies shows the formation of an initial strong 1:1 complex followed by a significantly weaker secondary binding. Isothermal calorimetry studies show that the interaction of cyanines is predominantly entropy driven. In line with the design principles, this work provides new insights for further developing potent, highly selective cyanines as promising quadruplex-specific agents.",,,"Calorimetry, Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, Fluorescent Dyes, G-Quadruplexes, Genes, myc, Halogens, Humans, Mass Spectrometry, Models, Molecular, Surface Plasmon Resonance, Thermodynamics",,

The presence of pyrazole unsubstituted at (1) N-position is essential to induce pH-dependent fluorescence intensity and lifetime changes in these dyes. Replacement of meso-chloro group of cyanine dye IR820 with (1) N-unsubstituted pyrazole resulted in the pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime changes from 0.93 ns in neutral media to 1.27 ns in acidic media in DMSO. Time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) revealed that at lower pH, the pyrazole consists of fluorophores with two distinct lifetimes, which cor-responds to pH-sensitive and non-pH-sensitive species. In contrast, (1) N-substituted pyrazoles do not exhibit pH response, suggesting excited state electron transfer as the mechanism of pH-dependent fluorescence lifetime sensitivity for this class of compounds.",,,"Carbocyanines, Dimethyl Sulfoxide, Electrons, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Indocyanine Green, Pyrazoles, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,

Carbazole was inserted into the structures of YO and Cy(3) to act as a bridge to link the benzoxazole and indole group. This modification resulted in a novel kind of benzoxazole indole styryl cyanine dye with a carbazole-bridged chain. The dyes were characterized by (1)HNMR and MS. The spectra of the novel dyes were also performed and the results showed that the maximum emission wavelength of the carbazole styryl cyanine dye was shifted red, the Stokes shift increased and the fluorescence intensity enhanced compared with those of YO and Cy(3).

The TPA contribution to the ns-OPL behavior is higher for both organic cyanines, while the main process is a TPA-induced ESA in the case of the organometallic system, in which the ruthenium induces a broadening of the NIR-ESA band and resulting in a strong spectral overlap between TPA and ESA spectra.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Molecular Structure, Organometallic Compounds, Ruthenium, Spectrophotometry",,

Structural changes in biological molecules or relative motion between two interacting molecules can be detected by a change in FRET. To study the conformational changes of individual molecules over extended time periods, the molecules must be immobilized on a coated surface that allows highly specific tethering of DNA, RNA, or protein. Nevertheless, there are always some fluorescent impurities on the surface and, without experience in sm imaging, it is often difficult to distinguish molecules of interest from impurities. This protocol describes the use of an imaging buffer that enhances the photostability of cyanine dyes used for smFRET, with emphasis on distinguishing molecules of interest from impurities.",,,"DNA, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Microscopy, Molecular Biology, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Protein Conformation, Proteins, RNA, Specimen Handling",,

22968489,The nature of the different environmental sensitivity of symmetrical and unsymmetrical cyanine dyes: an experimental and theoretical study.,"Symmetrical and unsymmetrical cyanine dyes are used in different applications due to their different fluorogenic behaviors toward bio-macromolecules and micro-environments. In the present paper, computational studies on these dyes reveal that the potential energy of the electronic excited state is controlled by C-C bond rotational motion, which causes mainly nonradiative deactivation, according to the activation energies for the rotation. The rotations of different C-C bonds in the molecules have quite different rotational activation energies. Symmetrical dyes (Cy) possess an obviously higher rotating energy barrier as well as a larger energy gap compared to unsymmetrical dyes (TO). The C-C bond rotation close to the quinoline moiety of unsymmetrical thiazole orange (TO) allows the dye to possess the lowest energy barrier and also the lowest energy gap. This rotation plays a major role in reducing fluorescence quantum yields and providing a low fluorescent background in the free states of the unsymmetrical cyanine dyes. The results might provide a foundation for the interpretation of the behavior of the dyes and are useful for the future design of new cyanine fluorophores.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cattle, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Structure, Quantum Theory, Rotation, Viscosity",,
22861666,Reversible fluorescence photoswitching in DNA.,"We describe the engineering of reversible fluorescence photoswitching in DNA with high-density substitution, and its applications in advanced fluorescence microscopy methods. High-density labeling of DNA with cyanine dyes can be achieved by polymerase chain reaction using a modified DNA polymerase that has been evolved to efficiently incorporate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cytosine base analogues into double-stranded DNA. The resulting biopolymer, ""CyDNA"", displays hundreds of fluorophores per DNA strand and is strongly colored and highly fluorescent, although previous observations suggest that fluorescence quenching at such high density might be a concern, especially for Cy5. Herein, we first investigate the mechanisms of fluorescence quenching in CyDNA and we suggest that two different mechanisms, aggregate formation and resonance energy transfer, are responsible for fluorescence quenching at high labeling densities. Moreover, we have been able to re-engineer CyDNA into a reversible fluorescence photoswitchable biopolymer by using the properties of the Cy3-Cy5 pair. This novel biopolymer constitutes a new class of photoactive DNA-based nanomaterial and is of great interest for advanced microscopy applications. We show that reversible fluorescence photoswitching in CyDNA can be exploited in optical lock-in detection imaging. It also lays the foundations for improved and sequence-specific super-resolution fluorescence microscopy of DNA.",,,"Cytosine, DNA, Fluorescence, Models, Molecular, Particle Size, Photochemical Processes, Surface Properties",,
22796218,Nanoemulsion-templated multilayer nanocapsules for cyanine-type photosensitizer delivery to human breast carcinoma cells.,"There is great clinical interest in developing novel nanocarriers for hydrophobic cyanine dyes used as photosensitizing agents in photodynamic therapy (PDT). In the present study we have employed nanoemulsion-templated oil-core multilayer nanocapsules as robust nanocarriers for a cyanine-type photosensitizer IR-786. These nanoproducts were fabricated via layer-by-layer (LbL) adsorption of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes (PEs), i.e., anionic PSS and cationic PDADMAC on nanoemulsion liquid cores created by dicephalic or bulky saccharide-derived cationic surfactants. All nanocapsules, with different thicknesses of the PE shell and average size <200 nm (measured by DLS) demonstrated good capacity for IR-786 encapsulation. The nanocarriers were visualized by SEM and AFM and their photo-induced anticancer effect and cellular internalization in human breast carcinoma MCF-7/WT cells were determined. Biological response of the cell culture, expressed as dark and photocytotoxicity as well as fluorescence of drug molecules loaded in the multilayer vehicles, analyzed by the FACS and CLSM techniques, have indicated that the delivered IR-786 did not aggregate inside the cells and could, therefore, act as an effective third-generation photosensitizing agent. In vitro biological experiments demonstrated that the properties of studied nanostructures depended upon the PE type and the envelope thickness as well as on the surfactant architecture in the nanoemulsion-based templates employed for the nanocapsule fabrication. Similarity of results obtained for stored (three weeks in the dark at room temperature) and freshly-prepared nanocapsules, attests to viability of this stable, promising drug delivery system for poorly water-soluble cyanines useful in PDT.",,,"Breast Neoplasms, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Emulsions, Humans, Indoles, MCF-7 Cells, Nanocapsules, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Polyethylenes, Polystyrenes, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, Surface-Active Agents",,
22779599,A three-state effective Hamiltonian for symmetric cationic diarylmethanes.,"We analyze the low-energy electronic structure of a series of symmetric cationic diarylmethanes, which are bridge-substituted derivatives of Michler's Hydrol Blue. We use a four-electron, three-orbital complete active space self-consistent field and multi-state multi-reference perturbation theory model to calculate a three-state diabatic effective Hamiltonian for each dye in the series. We exploit an isolobal analogy between the active spaces of the self-consistent field solutions for each dye to represent the electronic structure in a set of analogous diabatic states. The diabatic states can be identified with the bonding structures in classical resonance-theoretic models of cyanine dyes. We identify diabatic states with opposing charge and bond-order localization, analogous to the classical resonance structures, and a third state with charge on the bridge. While the left- and right-charged structures are similar for all dyes, the structure of the bridge-charged diabatic state, and the Hamiltonian matrix elements connected to it, change significantly across the series. The change is correlated with an inversion of the sign of the charge carrier on the bridge, which changes from an electron pair to a hole as the series is traversed.",,,,,
22752431,Tri- and pentamethine cyanine dyes for fluorescent detection of α-synuclein oligomeric aggregates.,"The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease that is the second most common neurodegenerative disease is associated with formation of different aggregates of α-synuclein (ASN), namely oligomers and amyloid fibrils. Current research is aimed on the design of fluorescent dyes for the detection of oligomeric aggregates, which are considered to be toxic and morbific spices. Fluorescent properties of series of benzothiazole trimethine and pentamethine cyanines were characterized in free state and in presence of monomeric, oligomeric and fibrilar ASN. The dyes with wide aromatic systems and bulky phenyl and alkyl substituents that are potentially able to interact with hydrophobic regions of oligomeric aggregates were selected for the studies. For majority of studied dyes noticeable changes in fluorescence characteristics were shown in the presence of fibrillar or oligomeric ASN, while the dyes slightly responded on the presence of monomeric protein. For pentamethine cyanine SL-631 and trimethine cyanine SH-299 certain specificity to oligomeric aggregates over fibrils was observed. Using these dyes at 10(-6) M concentration permits the detection of oligomeric ASN in the concentrations range of at least 0.2-2 microM. Pentamethine cyanine SL-631 is proposed as dye for fluorescent detection of oligomeric aggregates of ASN, while trimethine cyanine SH-299 is shown to be a sensitive probe both on oligomeric and fibrillar ASN. It is proposed that wide aromatic system of SL-631 pentamethine dye molecule could better fix on the less dense and structured oligomeric formation, while less bulky and more ""crescent-shape"" molecule of trimethine dye SH-299 could easier enter into the groove of beta-pleated structure.",,,"Amyloid, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Protein Multimerization, Protein Structure, Secondary, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Substrate Specificity, alpha-Synuclein",,

Several have recently emerged that offer excellent temperature sensitivity, spatial resolution, or cellular compatibility, but it has been challenging to realize all of these properties in a single construct. Here, we introduce a luminescent nanocrystal-based sensor that achieves this with a 2.4% change/°C ratiometric response over physiological temperatures in aqueous buffers, with a precision of at least 0.2 °C. Thermoresponsive dual emission is conferred by a Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET) process between CdSe-CdS quantum dot-quantum rods (QD-QRs) as donors and cyanine dyes as acceptors, which are conjugated to QD-QRs using an amphiphilic polymer coating. The nanothermometers were delivered to live cells using a pH-responsive cationic polymer colloid, which served to both improve uptake and release nanocrystals from endosomal confinement.

22482883,Development of biocompatible polymeric nanoparticles for in vivo NIR and FRET imaging.,"The majority of near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores are organic molecules that show significant overlap between the excitation and emission spectra and therefore exhibit high fluorescence backgrounds during in vivo imaging. Recently, cyanine dyes with a large Stokes shift have shown great promise for NIR imaging but often undergo rapid photodegradation and nonspecific protein adsorption. Alternatively, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a promising technique to generate a larger gap between the excitation and emission maxima and thus can reduce the background signal. Here, we report the rational design of FRET-based polymeric nanoparticles for NIR and FRET imaging. The particles were assembled from diblock copolymers of poly(d,l-lactic-co-glycolic acid) and maleimide-activated poly(ethylene glycol), which were also encapsulated with both the donor (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine) and acceptor (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindotricarbocyanine) fluorophores. Because of their extreme hydrophobicity, thousands of fluorophores could be encapsulated inside a single particle without causing leakage. FRET resulted in a large Stokes shift (>100 nm) of the emission maxima, and the transfer efficiency could be fine-tuned by further adjusting the doping ratio of the donor and acceptor fluorophores. The optimized formulation was less than 100 nm in size, brighter than quantum dots, stable in biological media, and demonstrated similar biodistribution to most nanomaterials. Additional animal phantom studies demonstrated that the FRET imaging platform developed could have far-reaching applications in optical imaging.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Female, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Lactic Acid, Mice, SCID, Nanoparticles, Optical Imaging, Polyethylene Glycols, Polyglycolic Acid, Polylactic Acid-Polyglycolic Acid Copolymer, Tissue Distribution",,

The utility of three novel classes of cyanine dyes designed for this purpose illustrates that the affinity interactions of ligands at the hydrophobic binding pockets of Human Serum Albumin (HSA) are not only dependent on the overall hydrophobic characteristics of the molecules but are highly influenced by the size of the ligands as well. Whereas changes to the chromophore moiety exhibited slight to moderate changes to the hydrophobic nature of these molecules, substitution at the alkyl indolium side chain has enabled us to vary the binding affinity towards serum albumin. Substitution at the indolium side chain among an ethyl to butyl group results in improved binding characteristics and an almost three-fold increase in affinity constant. In addition, replacement of the ethyl side chain with a phenylpropyl group also yielded unique solvotachromic patterns such as increased hydrophobicity and subsequent biocompatibility with the HSA binding regions. Ligand interaction was however inhibited by steric hindrance associated with the bulky phenyl ring system thus affecting the increased binding that could be realized from the improved hydrophobic nature of the molecules.

The hybrid construct transfers the pH sensitivity of photolabile NIR cyanine dyes to highly emissive and long-lifetime pH-insensitive QDs, thereby inducing a reproducible FLT change from 29 ns at pH >7 to 12 ns at pH <5. This approach provides an unparalleled large dynamic FLT range for pH sensing at NIR wavelengths.",,,"Fluorescence, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Microscopy, Electron, Transmission, Quantum Dots, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
22311756,Proteomic analysis of redox-dependent changes using cysteine-labeling 2D DIGE.,"Redox-modification of proteins plays an important role in the regulation of protein function and cellular physiology and in pathological conditions such as oncogenic activation, inhibition of tumor suppression, and ischemia reperfusion injury. This occurs, at least in part, through the reduction or oxidation of cysteine groups in these proteins resulting in the modulation of their activities. Herein, we focus on the development of a pair of cysteine-labeling iodoacetylated cyanine dyes (ICy3/5) for two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D DIGE) to monitor redox-dependent changes on cysteine residues. The method is applied to a cellular model of human mammary luminal epithelial cells treated with H(2)O(2) to induce oxidative stress. Differences in labeling are caused either by differential protein expression or from the loss or gain of reactive thiol groups of cysteines in response to oxidative stress. Proteins displaying differential labeling would then be picked for MS-based identification. In summary, this cysteine-labeling 2D-DIGE approach provides an MS-compatible and reproducible technique for identifying alterations in the expression and redox-modification of free thiol-containing proteins.",,,"Cysteine, Humans, Immunoblotting, Iodoacetamide, Oxidation-Reduction, Proteomics, Reproducibility of Results, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, Staining and Labeling, Tissue Culture Techniques, Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis",,
22311755,2D DIGE saturation labeling for minute sample amounts.,"The 2D DIGE technique, based on fluorophores covalently linked to amino acid side chain residues and the concept of an internal standard, has significantly improved reproducibility, sensitivity, and the dynamic range of protein quantification. In saturation DIGE, sulfhydryl groups of cysteines are labeled with cyanine dyes to completion, providing a so far unraveled sensitivity for protein detection and quantification in 2D gel-based proteomic experiments. Only a few micrograms of protein per 2D gel facilitate the analysis of about 2,000 analytes from complex mammalian cell or tissue samples. As a consequence, 2D saturation DIGE is the method of choice when only minute sample amounts are available for quantitative proteome analysis at the level of proteins rather than peptides. Since very low amounts of samples have to be handled in a reproducible manner, saturation DIGE-based proteomic experiments are technically demanding. Moreover, successful saturation DIGE approaches require a strict adherence to adequate reaction conditions at each step. This chapter is dedicated to colleagues already experienced in 2D PAGE protein separation and intends to support the establishment of this ultrasensitive technique in proteomic workgroups. We provide basic guidelines for the experimental design and discuss crucial aspects concerning labeling chemistry, sample preparation, and pitfalls caused by labeling artifacts. A detailed step-by-step protocol comprises all aspects from initial sample preparation to image analysis and statistical evaluation. Furthermore, we describe the generation of preparative saturation DIGE gels necessary for mass spectrometry-based spot identification.",,,"Analytic Sample Preparation Methods, Filtration, Humans, Mass Spectrometry, Proteins, Proteomics, Staining and Labeling, Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis",,

22143523,Identification of new antileishmanial leads from hits obtained by high-throughput screening.,"A previous screen of ~200,000 compounds from the PubChem database identified 70 compounds possessing 50% effective concentrations (EC(50)s) below 1 μM against Leishmania major promastigotes that were not toxic to mammalian epithelial cancer cells at this concentration (E. Sharlow et al., PLoS Negl. Trop. Dis. 3:e540, 2009). Based on availability and chemical exclusion criteria, 31 of these compounds were purchased from commercial suppliers and evaluated for in vitro activity against intracellular L. donovani and L. amazonensis parasites. Benzothiazole cyanine compounds (PubChem 16196319 and 16196223) displayed potent activity against intracellular amastigotes, prompting a search for commercially available compounds that were structurally related. Pubchem 123859 (the cyanine dye thiazole orange) showed exceptionally potent activity against intracellular L. donovani in vitro (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 21 ± 12 nM) and low cytotoxicity against Vero cells (IC(50) = 7,800 ± 200 nM). Administration of 123859 and 16196319 at a dose of 1 mg/kg of body weight intraperitoneally (i.p.) daily for 5 days resulted in 44% ± 4% and 42% ± 3% suppression of liver parasitemia in L. donovani-infected BALB/c mice, respectively, compared to the untreated control group (the reductions in liver parasitemia were 30% ± 5% and 27% ± 4%, respectively, compared to the (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin solution (HPβCD) vehicle control, which itself displayed some antileishmanial activity).

These platinum complexes contain cholylglycinate (CG) and ursodeoxycholate (UDC) as ligands. These compounds enable qualitative detection of double-helix DNA and quantitative detection (from pg to μg). These novel compounds have absorption and emission spectra in a difference range as the common ones (for example: cyanine dyes such as Cy3, Cy5, Cy7,…); therefore, it could allow the multi-parametric detection of DNA arrays, incrementing the capacity of experimental performance per one single array. As a consequence, it will increase the amount of data info obtained per chip. The combination of the intrinsic property of this compounds with the optical properties in different fluorescence channels, can allow introducing a new molecule with a wide range of possible applications in DNA arrays.",,,"DNA, Ethylenediamines, Fluorescent Dyes, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Organometallic Compounds, Organoplatinum Compounds, Platinum, Reproducibility of Results, Spectrophotometry",,

Carbazole was inserted into the methylidyne structure of TO as a bridge to afford a kind of novel styryl cyanine dye with carbazole bridged chain. The dyes were characterized by HNMR and MS. The spectra of the novel dyes were also studied and the results showed that the fluorescent wavelength of novel carbzole dye shifted red for 100 nm, stock shift increased by 70 nm and the fluorescent intensity enhanced by 70 times compared to that of TO. When the novel dye was labeled by BSA, its fluorescent wavelength changed little and the intensity enhanced.

22034863,Activatable optical imaging with a silica-rhodamine based near infrared (SiR700) fluorophore: a comparison with cyanine based dyes.,"Optical imaging is emerging as an important tool to visualize tumors. However, there are many potential choices among the available fluorophores. Optical imaging probes that emit in the visible range can image superficial tumors with high quantum yields; however, if deeper imaging is needed then near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores are necessary. Most commercially available NIR fluorophores are cyanine based and are prone to nonspecific binding and relatively limited photostability. Silica-containing rhodamine (SiR) fluorophores represent a new class of NIR fluorophores, which permit photoactivation via H-dimer formation as well as demonstrate improved photostability. This permits higher tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs) to be achieved over longer periods of time. Here, we compared an avidin conjugated with SiR700 (Av-SiR700) to similar compounds based on cyanine dyes (Av-Cy5.5 and Av-Alexa Fluor 680) in a mouse tumor model of ovarian cancer metastasis. We found that the Av-SiR700 probe demonstrated superior quenching, enabling activation after binding-internalization to the target cell. As a result, Av-SiR700 had higher TBRs compared to Av-Cy5.5 and better biostability compared to Av-Alexa Fluor 680.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Dimerization, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Mice, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Ovarian Neoplasms, Rhodamines, Silicon Dioxide",,
22024362,Targeted non-covalent self-assembled nanoparticles based on human serum albumin.,"Human serum albumin (HSA) is a biological nanocarrier that forms non-covalent complexes with a number of synthetic and biomolecules. Previously we demonstrated radiolabeled HSA-based nanoparticles can form non-covalent complexes with fluorescent cyanine dyes yielding imaging agents for surgical guidance towards tumor draining lymph nodes. Here the self-assembly approach enabled rapid clinical translation. Based on this experience we reasoned it would be interesting to expand this non-covalent technology to a targeted approach. Therefore, the ability of HSA to form non-covalent self-assembled complexes with peptides via near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dyes was explored. Föster resonance energy transfer (FRET) quenching interactions between HSA-Cy5 and the non-covalently bound fluorescent molecules indocyanine green (ICG), IR783-CO(2)H and three IR783-labeled targeting peptides were used to monitor complex assembly and disassembly. The host-guest interactions between HSA and IR783-labeled peptides enabled the formation of (bio)nanoparticles that are coated with peptides, which may target α(v)β(3)-integrins, the chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), or somatostatin receptors. The potential of CXCR4-targeted (bio)nanoparticles in sentinel lymph node procedures is demonstrated in vivo. By non-covalently binding NIR-dye labeled peptides to an already clinically approved HSA-scaffold, we have readily formed targeted bionanoparticles.",,,"Animals, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Humans, Lymph Nodes, Mice, Models, Theoretical, Nanoparticles, Peptides, Serum Albumin",,
21985310,"Synthesis, photophysical, electrochemical, tumor-imaging, and phototherapeutic properties of purpurinimide-N-substituted cyanine dyes joined with variable lengths of linkers.","Purpurinimide methyl esters, bearing variable lengths of N-substitutions, were conjugated individually to a cyanine dye with a carboxylic acid functionality. The results obtained from in vitro and in vivo studies showed a significant impact of the linkers joining the phototherapeutic and fluorescence imaging moieties. The photosensitizer-fluorophore conjugate with a PEG linker showed the highest uptake in the liver, whereas the conjugate linked with two carbon units showed excellent tumor-imaging and PDT efficacy at 24 h postinjection. Whole body imaging and biodistribution studies at variable time points portrayed enhanced fluorescent uptake of the conjugates in the tumor compared to that in the skin. Interestingly, the conjugate with the shortest linker and the one joining with two carbon units showed faster clearance from normal organs, e.g., the liver, kidney, spleen, and lung, compared to that in tumors. Both imaging and PDT efficacy of the conjugates were performed in BALB/c mice bearing Colon26 tumors. Compared to the others, the short linker conjugate showed poor tumor fluorescent properties and as a corollary does not exhibit the dual functionality of the photosensitizer-fluorophore conjugate. For this reason, it was not evaluated for in vivo PDT efficacy. However, in Colon26 tumor cells (in vitro), the short linker was highly effective. Among the conjugates with variable linkers, the rate of energy transfer from the purpurinimide moiety to the cyanine moiety increased with deceasing linker length, as examined by femtosecond laser flash photolysis measurements. No electron transfer from the purpurinimide moiety to the singlet excited state of the cyanine moiety or from the singlet excited state of the cyanine moiety to the purpurinimide moiety occurred as indicated by a comparison of transient absorption spectra with spectra of the one-electron oxidized and one-electron reduced species of the conjugate obtained by spectroelectrochemical measurements.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cross-Linking Reagents, Electrochemical Techniques, Humans, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Nude, Models, Molecular, Molecular Structure, Neoplasms, Experimental, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Polyethylene Glycols, Tissue Distribution",,
21928779,DNA in a polyvinyl alcohol matrix and interactions with three intercalating cyanine dyes.,"We investigate how DNA interacts with drugs in humid polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) films by using a homologous set of cyanine dyes (YO(+), YO-PRO(2+), and YOYO(4+)) known to intercalate into DNA with increasing affinity with increasing charge. UV-vis spectroscopy shows that the PVA matrix destabilizes all three DNA-dye complexes compared to aqueous solution but to a lesser degree as the dye charge increases. The monovalent YO is fully dissociated from DNA within minutes, whereas the dissociation of the divalent YO-PRO takes about one hour and occurs by a two-step mechanism. The tetravalent homodimer YOYO is even less affected by the PVA environment and remains intercalated in the B-form DNA also in the PVA films. The reduced stability of the DNA-dye complexes is discussed in terms of steric and dielectric properties of the PVA matrix. After being kept in dry PVA films for 48 h the DNA-YOYO complexes can be reformed reversibly by rehumidifying the films for 30 min. The ability to store aligned and confined DNA intercalated with ligand complexes may be useful in studies on structural properties of nucleic acids.",,,"Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, DNA, B-Form, Intercalating Agents, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",,

The dyes exhibited substantial fluorescence enhancements upon binding. In the presence of homologous guanine-rich peptide nucleic acid oligomers, PNA-DNA heteroquadruplexes were formed. The dyes retained their ability to bind to the heteroquadruplexes at low micromolar concentrations and with varying fluorescence enhancements, although indeterminate stoichiometries preclude quantitative comparison of the affinities with the DNA homoquadruplex precursor. The difference in fluorescence enhancement between DNA homoquadruplex and PNA-DNA heteroquadruplex allows the dyes to be used as fluorogenic indicators of hybridization in a facile method for determining PNA-DNA stoichiometry.",,,,,

The cyanine nucleic acid binding dyes TO-PRO-3 and TOTO-3 iodide enabled a clear detection of microbial cells in a mineral soil, while nonspecific background was greatly reduced compared with commonly used dyes. When used as counterstains for fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), both cyanine dyes allowed identification of microbial cells despite strong background from nonspecifically bound probes.

We report the 2P characteristics of common NIR polymethine dyes, including their 2P action cross sections and the 2P excited fluorescence lifetime. One of the dyes, DTTC, showed the highest 2P action cross-section (∼103 ± 19 GM) and relatively high 2P excited fluorescence lifetime and can be used as a scaffold for the synthesis of 2P molecular imaging probes. The 2P action cross-section of DTTC and the lifetime were also highly sensitive to the solvent polarity, providing other additional parameters for its use in optical imaging and the mechanism for probing environmental factors. Overall, this study demonstrated the quantitative measurement of 2P properties of NIR dyes and established the foundation for designing molecular probes for 2P imaging applications in the NIR region.",,,"Animals, Coloring Agents, Kidney, Mice, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Photons, Quantum Theory, Solvents",,

H-aggregates can be precipitated from solutions of cyanine dyes in nanostructured [6,6]-phenyl C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) template films. H-aggregates synthesized that way have a narrow line shape width comparable to the smallest H-bands reported for thin films so far. We demonstrate that H-aggregates can be induced in different cyanine dyes (trimethine-, pentamethine- and heptamethine dyes). Aggregation follows a universal pathway, the concentration dependence of aggregation for different dyes can be scaled to fall onto one master curve. According to our model, H-aggregates have the form of 3D-crystals that form within cavities of the template. The template substrate is fabricated by means of a phase separation process of PCBM with a specific cyanine dye and consecutive selective dissolution of the dye. The dimensions of the template cavities have a major influence on aggregation.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fullerenes, Nanostructures, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

Studies of nucleic acid structure and dynamics use these dyes, and they are ubiquitous in microarray experiments. They are sensitive to their environment and have higher quantum yield when bound to DNA. The fluorescent intensity of terminal cyanine dyes is also known to be significantly dependent on the base sequence of the oligonucleotide. We have developed a very precise and high-throughput method to evaluate the sequence dependence of oligonucleotide labeling dyes using microarrays and have applied the method to Cy3 and Cy5. We used light-directed in-situ synthesis of terminally-labeled microarrays to determine the fluorescence intensity of each dye on all 1024 possible 5'-labeled 5-mers. Their intensity is sensitive to all five bases. Their fluorescence is higher with 5' guanines, and adenines in subsequent positions. Cytosine suppresses fluorescence. Intensity falls by half over the range of all 5-mers for Cy3, and two-thirds for Cy5. Labeling with 5'-biotin-streptavidin-Cy3/-Cy5 gives a completely different sequence dependence and greatly reduces fluorescence compared with direct terminal labeling.",,,"Base Sequence, Biotin, Carbocyanines, DNA, Genomics, Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Organophosphorus Compounds, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

For both sets of dyes, increasing alkyl chain length resulted in no significant change in quantum yield or molar absorptivity. These results may be useful in designing new cyanine dyes for analytical applications and predicting their spectroscopic properties.",,,,,
21751257,Chirality generated by flows in pseudocyanine dye J-aggregates: revisiting 40 years old reports.,"Spontaneous symmetry breaking in J-aggregates of cyanine dyes has a long history in chemical literature. In 1976, Honda and Hada claimed that they had achieved chiral induction (CD) by stirring J-aggregates of pseudocyanine. However, this report is controversial, as the combinations of linear dichroism and birefringence can lead to artifactual circular dichroic signals that are unrelated to molecular chirality. A Mueller matrix spectroscopy study, with an approach for the application of a gradient of the shear rate (solution layer between a rotating and a fixed disk) that differs from the simple vortex stirring used in the original report, shows that true CD can be induced in the sample. The phenomenon is discussed, taking into account the flow dynamics that allows the alignment of the aggregate particles and the gradient of shear rates that determines their folding/torsion, which leads to a chiral excitonic transition.",,,,,

ICG is a clinically approved imaging agent, and its derivative SIDAG is a more hydrophilic counterpart that has recently shown promising imaging properties in preclinical studies. The rather lipophilic ICG has a very short plasma half-life, thus limiting the time available to image body regions during its vascular circulation (e.g., the breast in optical mammography where scanning over several minutes is required). In order to change the physicochemical properties of the indotricarbocyanine dye backbone, several derivatives were synthesized with increasing hydrophilicity. The most hydrophilic dye SIDAG is selected for further biological characterization. The acute tolerance of SIDAG in mice is increased up to 60-fold compared to ICG. Contrary to ICG, the pharmacokinetic properties of SIDAG are shifted toward renal elimination, caused by the high hydrophilicity of the molecule. N-Nitrosomethylurea (NMU)-induced rat breast carcinomas are clearly demarcated, both immediately and 24 h after intravenous administration of SIDAG, whereas ICG shows a weak tumor contrast under the same conditions. Our findings demonstrate that SIDAG is a high potential contrast agent for optical imaging, which could increase the sensitivity for detection of inflamed regions and tumors.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Contrast Media, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Indocyanine Green, Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
21671666,"Long-wavelength absorbing and fluorescent chameleon labels for proteins, peptides, and amines.","Long-wavelength absorbing labels that change their color and fluorescence upon conjugation to proteins and other biomolecules provide two critical advantages over the wealth of conventional amine-reactive labels. At first, the progress of the labeling reaction can be monitored continuously either visually or by spectrometry without prior purification. Then, the labeled biomolecule can be investigated with red or near-infrared light, which minimizes background interference in biological samples. These unique characteristics are met by a group of long-wavelength absorbing cyanine dyes carrying a reactive chloro substituent for nucleophilic substitution with primary amines, which is accompanied by a color change from green to blue. In addition to this so-called chameleon effect, the dyes display an increase in fluorescence during the labeling reaction. Despite their structural similarity, the reactivity of the dyes differs strongly. The fastest labeling kinetics is observed with dye S 0378 as its five-membered ring affords a stabilizing effect on the intermediate carbocation during an S(N)1-type of nucleophilic substitution.

Here we demonstrate that Cy5--a fluorescent molecule that does not enter cells by itself--can be loaded into cells by attaching a short oligonucleotide. This very inexpensive labeling procedure can be done in the presence of serum. Therefore, very sensitive cell types should also be amenable to this procedure, and longer observations can be achieved compared to other commercially available dyes as the labeling reagent does not need to be washed out. This also points to the pitfall of using fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides for live cell imaging where the oligonucleotide is supposed to detect a specific target sequence in its subcellular distribution.",,,"Carbocyanines, Cells, Cultured, Cytological Techniques, Humans, Mesenchymal Stem Cells, Microscopy, Mitochondria, Oligonucleotides, Staining and Labeling",,

Special attention was devoted to the plasma protein binding capacity and related pharmacokinetic properties. Four members of the DY-67x cyanine family composed of the same main chromophore, but substituted with a sequentially increasing number of sulfonate groups (n  =  1-4; DY-675, DY-676, DY-677, DY-678, respectively), were incubated with plasma proteins dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline. Protein binding was assessed by absorption spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis, ultrafiltration, and dialysis. Distribution of dye in organs was studied by intraveneous injection of 62 nmol dye/kg body weight into mice (n  =  12; up to 180 minutes postinjection) using whole-body near-infrared fluorescence imaging. Spectroscopic studies, gel electrophoresis, and dialysis demonstrated reduced protein binding with increasing number of sulfonate groups. The bovine serum albumin binding constant of the most hydrophobic dye, DY-675, is 18 times higher than that of the most hydrophilic fluorophore, DY-678. In vivo biodistribution analysis underlined a considerable influence of dye hydrophilicity on biodistribution and excretion pathways, with the more hydrophobic dyes, DY-675 and DY-676, accumulating in the liver, followed by strong fluorescence signals in bile and gut owing to accumulation in feces and comparatively hydrophilic DY-678-COOH accumulating in the bladder. Our results demonstrate the possibility of selectively controlling dye-protein interactions and, thus, biodistribution and excretion pathways via proper choice of the fluorophore's substitution pattern. This underlines the importance of structure-property relationships for fluorescent labels.

21376147,Quantitative plasma proteome analysis reveals aberrant level of blood coagulation-related proteins in nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), one of the most common cancers in Southeast Asia, is not easily diagnosed until advanced stages. To discover potential biomarkers for improving NPC diagnosis, we herein identified the aberrant plasma proteins in NPC patients. We first removed the top-seven abundant proteins from plasma samples of healthy controls and NPC patients, and then labeled the samples with different fluorescent cyanine dyes. The labeled samples were then mixed equally and fractionated with ion-exchange chromatography followed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins showing altered levels in NPC patients were identified by in-gel tryptic digestion and LC-MS/MS. When the biological roles of the 45 identified proteins were assessed via MetaCore™ analysis, the blood coagulation pathway emerged as the most significantly altered pathway in NPC plasma. Plasma kallikrein (KLKB1) and thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT) were chosen for evaluation as the candidate NPC biomarkers because of their involvement in blood coagulation. ELISAs confirmed the elevation of their plasma levels in NPC patients versus healthy controls. Western blot and activity assays further showed that the KLKB1 active form was significantly increased in NPC plasma. Collectively, our results identified the significant alteration of blood coagulation pathway in NPC patients, and KLKB1 and TAT may represent the potential NPC biomarkers.",,,"Asia, Southeastern, Blood Coagulation, Blood Coagulation Factors, Carcinoma, Female, Humans, Male, Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma, Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms, Neoplasm Proteins, Proteome, Proteomics",,
21361307,New cyanine dyes or not? Theoretical insights for model chains.,"The quest of organic dyes presenting improved electronic features has been extremely active during the last decades, as new structures are necessary to build novel materials such as dye-sensitized solar cells, nonlinear optics commutators, or molecular photochromic switches. Cyanine derivatives occupy a key spot in that scene, as they present intense absorption bands and tunable colors, even when a relatively short π-conjugated path is used. This behavior has often been interpreted as a consequence of a negligible bond length alternation. Recently, Thorley et al. have designed and characterized new cationic compounds that possess the cyanine electronic features, though presenting sizable bond length alternation (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2008, 47, 7095-7098). In this contribution, I investigate, with quantum mechanical tools, the size dependence of these properties in model symmetric dyes displaying Thorley's patterns. Extended chains are simulated in order to obtain insights into the chain length convergence, and the results are compared to those obtained at the same level of theory for classical cyanine architectures. This theoretical work is a step toward the rational development of more efficient π-conjugated compounds.",,,,,
21337432,Combining aminocyanine dyes with polyamide dendrons: a promising strategy for imaging in the near-infrared region.,"Cyanine dyes are known for their fluorescence in the near-IR (NIR) region, which is desirable for biological applications. We report the synthesis of a series of aminocyanine dyes containing terminal functional groups such as acid, azide, and cyclooctyne groups for further functionalization through, for example, click chemistry. These aminocyanine dyes can be attached to polyfunctional dendrons by copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), strain-promoted azide alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), peptide coupling, or direct S(NR)1 reactions. The resulting dendron-dye conjugates were obtained in high yields and displayed high chemical stability and photostability. The optical properties of the new compounds were studied by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. All compounds show large Stokes shifts and strong fluorescence in the NIR region with high quantum yields, which are optimal properties for in vivo optical imaging.",,,"Alkynes, Carbocyanines, Catalysis, Click Chemistry, Coloring Agents, Copper, Cyclization, Dendrimers, Diagnostic Imaging, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Structure, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
21329363,Rational approach to select small peptide molecular probes labeled with fluorescent cyanine dyes for in vivo optical imaging.,"We demonstrate that the structure of carbocyanine dyes, which are commonly used to label small peptides for molecular imaging and not the bound peptide, controls the rate of extravasation from blood vessels to tissue. By examining several near-infrared (NIR) carbocyanine fluorophores, we demonstrate a quantitative correlation between the binding of a dye to albumin, a model plasma protein, and the rate of extravasation of the probe into tissue. Binding of the dyes was measured by fluorescence quenching of the tryptophans in albumin and was found to be inversely proportional to the rate of extravasation. The rate of extravasation, determined by kurtosis from longitudinal imaging studies using rodent ear models, provided a basis for quantitative measurements. Structure-activity studies aimed at evaluating a representative library of NIR fluorescent cyanine probes showed that hydrophilic dyes with binding constants several orders of magnitude lower than their hydrophobic counterparts have much faster extravasation rate, establishing a foundation for rational probe design. The correlation provides a guideline for dye selection in optical imaging and a method to verify if a certain dye is optimal for a specific molecular imaging application.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Extravasation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Materials, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Kinetics, Mice, Molecular Imaging, Molecular Probes, Oligopeptides, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Structure-Activity Relationship",,

The validity of TRTG is established by theory and experiment. The TRTG signal is shown to follow the transition frequency correlation function by an analytic expression based on the response function theory for delta function pulses and by model numerical calculations including finite pulse durations. TRTG is demonstrated for two cyanine dyes IR144 and IR125 in methanol by using a diffractive-optics based four wave mixing apparatus. Solvation dynamics in methanol obtained from the TRTG are consistent with those reported previously confirming the validity of TRTG.",,,"Carbocyanines, Quantum Theory",,
26596164,Electronic Excitations of Simple Cyanine Dyes: Reconciling Density Functional and Wave Function Methods.,"The simplest cyanine dye series [H2N(CH)nNH2](+) with n = 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 appears to be a challenge for all theoretical excited-state methods since the experimental spectra are difficult to predict and the observed deviations cannot be easily explained with standard arguments. We compute here the lowest vertical excitation energies of these dyes using a variety of approaches, namely, complete active space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2), quantum Monte Carlo methods (QMC), coupled cluster linear response up to third approximate order (CC3), and various flavors of time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT), including the recently proposed perturbative correction scheme (B2PLYP). In our calculations, all parameters such as basis set, active space, and geometry dependence are carefully analyzed. We find that all wave function methods give reasonably close excitation energies, with CASPT2 yielding the lowest values, and that the B2PLYP scheme gives excitations in satisfactory agreement with CC3 and DMC, significantly improving on the generalized gradient and hybrid approximations. Finally, to resolve the remaining discrepancy between predicted excitation energies and experimental absorption spectra, we also investigate the effect of excited-state relaxation. Our results indicate that a direct comparison of the experimental absorption maxima and the theoretical vertical excitations is not possible due to the presence of nonvertical transitions. The apparent agreement of earlier CASPT2 calculations with experiments was an artifact of the choice of active space and the use of an older definition of the zero-order Hamiltonian.",,,,,
21250654,Fluorescence quantum yields of a series of red and near-infrared dyes emitting at 600-1000 nm.,"The determination of the fluorescence quantum yields (QY, Φ(f)) of a series of fluorescent dyes that span the absorption/excitation and emission ranges of 520-900 and 600-1000 nm is reported. The dyes encompass commercially available rhodamine 101 (Rh-101, Φ(f) = 0.913), cresyl violet (0.578), oxazine 170 (0.579), oxazine 1 (0.141), cryptocyanine (0.012), HITCI (0.283), IR-125 (0.132), IR-140 (0.167), and four noncommercial cyanine dyes with specific spectroscopic features, all of them in dilute ethanol solution. The QYs have been measured relative to the National Institute of Standards and Technology's standard reference material (SRM) 936a (quinine sulfate, QS) on a traceably characterized fluorometer, employing a chain of transfer standard dyes that include coumarin 102 (Φ(f) = 0.764), coumarin 153 (0.544), and DCM (0.435) as links between QS and Rh-101. The QY of Rh-101 has also been verified in direct measurements against QS using two approaches that rely only on instrument correction.

21184489,DNA and chromatin imaging with super-resolution fluorescence microscopy based on single-molecule localization.,"With the expansion of super-resolution fluorescence microscopy methods, it is now possible to access the organization of cells and materials at the nanoscale by optical means. This review discusses recent progress in super-resolution imaging of isolated and cell DNA using single-molecule localization methods. A high labeling density of photoswitchable fluorophores is crucial for these techniques, which can be provided by sequence independent DNA stains in which photoblinking reactions can be induced. In particular, unsymmetrical cyanine intercalating dyes in combination with special buffers can be used to image isolated DNA with a spatial resolution of 30-40 nm. For super-resolution imaging of chromatin, cell permeant cyanine dyes that bind the minor groove of DNA have the potential to become a useful alternative to the labeling of histones and other DNA-associated proteins. Other recent developments that are interesting in this context such as high density labeling methods or new DNA probes with photoswitching functionalities are also surveyed. Progress in labeling, optics, and single-molecule localization algorithms is being rapid, and it is likely to provide real insight into DNA structuring in cells and materials.",,,"Animals, Chromatin, Coloring Agents, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Intercalating Agents, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Models, Molecular, Molecular Imaging, Photochemical Processes",,
21180706,Blue fluorescent dye-protein complexes based on fluorogenic cyanine dyes and single chain antibody fragments.,"Fluoromodules are complexes formed upon the noncovalent binding of a fluorogenic dye to its cognate biomolecular partner, which significantly enhances the fluorescence quantum yield of the dye. Previously, several single-chain, variable fragment (scFv) antibodies were selected from a yeast cell surface-displayed library that activated fluorescence from a family of unsymmetrical cyanine dyes covering much of the visible and near-IR spectrum. The current work expands our repertoire of genetically encodable scFv-dye pairs by selecting and characterizing a group of scFvs that activate fluorogenic violet-absorbing, blue-fluorescing cyanine dyes, based on oxazole and thiazole heterocycles. The dye binds to both yeast cell surface-displayed and soluble scFvs with low nanomolar K(d) values. These dye-protein fluoromodules exhibit high quantum yields, approaching unity for the brightest system. The promiscuity of these scFvs with other fluorogenic cyanine dyes was also examined. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that the yeast cell surface-displayed scFvs can be used for multicolor imaging. The prevalence of 405 nm lasers on confocal imaging and flow cytometry systems make these new reagents potentially valuable for cell biological studies.",,,"Color, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Structure, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Single-Chain Antibodies",,

The complex formation of IR806 with HSA modifies the native structure of IR806, resulting in time-dependent changes in its optical properties. The modification process of the dye and its complex formation with HSA is very slow and takes about 90 min. The process of the formation of the new complex is irreversible and totally controlled by the initial complex of IR806 and HSA. As far as we know, this new property of cyanine dyes has not been reported before. These properties are very important for near-infrared fluorescence imaging.",,,"Absorption, Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Humans, Serum Albumin, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Time Factors",,
21108866,Cyanine dyes in biophysical research: the photophysics of polymethine fluorescent dyes in biomolecular environments.,"The breakthroughs in single molecule spectroscopy of the last decade and the recent advances in super resolution microscopy have boosted the popularity of cyanine dyes in biophysical research. These applications have motivated the investigation of the reactions and relaxation processes that cyanines undergo in their electronically excited states. Studies show that the triplet state is a key intermediate in the photochemical reactions that limit the photostability of cyanine dyes. The removal of oxygen greatly reduces photobleaching, but induces rapid intensity fluctuations (blinking). The existence of non-fluorescent states lasting from milliseconds to seconds was early identified as a limitation in single-molecule spectroscopy and a potential source of artifacts. Recent studies demonstrate that a combination of oxidizing and reducing agents is the most efficient way of guaranteeing that the ground state is recovered rapidly and efficiently. Thiol-containing reducing agents have been identified as the source of long-lived dark states in some cyanines that can be photochemically switched back to the emissive state. The mechanism of this process is the reversible addition of the thiol-containing compound to a double bond in the polymethine chain resulting in a non-fluorescent molecule. This process can be reverted by irradiation at shorter wavelengths. Another mechanism that leads to non-fluorescent states in cyanine dyes is cis-trans isomerization from the singlet-excited state. This process, which competes with fluorescence, involves the rotation of one-half of the molecule with respect to the other with an efficiency that depends strongly on steric effects. The efficiency of fluorescence of most cyanine dyes has been shown to depend dramatically on their molecular environment within the biomolecule. For example, the fluorescence quantum yield of Cy3 linked covalently to DNA depends on the type of linkage used for attachment, DNA sequence and secondary structure. Cyanines linked to the DNA termini have been shown to be mostly stacked at the end of the helix, while cyanines linked to the DNA internally are believed to partially bind to the minor or major grooves. These interactions not only affect the photophysical properties of the probes but also create a large uncertainty in their orientation.",,,"Biophysics, Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Photochemical Processes, Spectrum Analysis",,

21048314,Cyanine dyes attenuate cerebral ischemia and reperfusion injury in rats.,"Some photosensitizing cyanine dyes act on the immune system to enhance the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. In this study, we examined whether these dyes have neurotrophin-like activities and neuroprotective effects in vitro and in vivo. By screening more than 250 cyanine dyes, we found that NK-4 and NK-150, which belong to a group of pentamethine trinuclear cyanine dyes, significantly potentiated nerve growth factor (NGF)-primed neurite outgrowth of PC12HS cells in nanomolar to micromolar concentrations. Both NK-4 and NK-150 showed a remarkable hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity using an in vitro electron spin resonance (ESR)-based technique. They also effectively scavenged peroxy radicals, and in addition, NK-4 acted on superoxides to a similar extent as ascorbate. In vivo, NK-4 and NK-150 prevented cerebral ischemic injury induced by 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24 h reperfusion in rats. Dyes were intravenously administrated twice 1 h after the occlusion and immediately after the start of reperfusion. NK-4 and NK-150 (100 µg/kg) reduced cerebral infarct volumes by 57.0% and 46.0%, respectively. Those dyes also decreased brain swelling in the ischemic semispheres. As a result, administration of NK-4 and NK-150 provided substantial improvements in MCAO-induced neurological deficits in a dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that NK-4 and NK-150 effectively prevented ischemia-induced brain injury through their potent neurotrophin-like activity as well as antioxidative activity.",,,"Animals, Antioxidants, Brain, Brain Ischemia, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Cerebral Infarction, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Edema, Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy, Infarction, Middle Cerebral Artery, Male, Nerve Growth Factor, Neurites, Neuroprotective Agents, Quinolines, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Reactive Oxygen Species, Reperfusion Injury",,
20942435,Local viscosity analysis of triblock copolymer micelle with cyanine dyes as a fluorescent probe.,"The local viscosity of Pluronic F127 triblock copolymer micelles in water was determined with cyanine dyes as fluorescent probes. These dyes show very weak fluorescence at a low temperature, but show enhanced fluorescence at a temperature higher than the critical micellization temperature (T(cm)). This is because a viscous environment within the micelle suppresses the formation of a nonradiative twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) excited state of the dyes. The good correlation between the fluorescence quantum yields of the dyes and the viscosity and the temperature of the media allows a determination of local viscosity of micelle based on the fluorescence quantum yields. The local viscosity of both core and corona regions of micelles increases at >T(cm) and shows a maximum at a temperature 7-9 °C higher than T(cm), and decreases at higher temperature due to the increased fluidity. The core viscosity is larger than that of the corona, and the corona viscosity increases toward the micelle center. The polymer concentration has different effects on the core and corona viscosity: the corona viscosity increases with a polymer concentration increase at the entire temperature range, whereas the core viscosity increases only at a low temperature. The corona viscosity increase is due to the condensation of a large number of polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks. In contrast, the dehydration degree of polypropylene oxide (PPO) blocks in the core scarcely changes, and the core has a similar composition regardless of polymer concentration. The larger polymer concentration promotes a micelle formation at lower temperature where the fluidity increase is very weak, resulting in larger core viscosity.",,,,,
20839112,Urinary proteome profiling using 2D-DIGE and LC-MS/MS.,"Proteomic methodologies have been at the forefront of cancer research for several years.

Onco-proteomics has the potential to impact on oncology practice by delivering individualised highly selective clinical care. 2D-DIGE (2D difference in gel electrophoresis) enables simultaneous examination and comparison of multiple samples using cyanine dyes to label amino acid residues that are then separated based on charge and mass.

These dyes were characterized by spectral-luminescent methods in the presence of G-quadruplex, triplex and dsDNA motifs. We have demonstrated that Cyan 2 binds strongly and preferentially to triple- and quadruple-stranded DNA forms that results in a strong enhancement of the dye fluorescence, as compared to dsDNA, while Cyan 40 form fluorescent complexes preferentially only with the triplex form. Highly fluorescent complexes of Cyan 2 with DNA triplexes and G-quadruplexes and Cyan 40 with DNA triplexes are very stable and do not dissociate during gel electrophoresis, leading to preferential staining of the above DNA forms in gels. The data presented point to the intercalation mechanism of the Cyan 2 binding to G4-DNA, while the complexes of Cyan 40 and Cyan 2 with triplex DNA are believed to be formed via groove binding mode.

20725060,Leptin modulated changes in adipose tissue protein expression in ob/ob mice.,"Comparative proteomic analyses were performed in adipose tissue of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice treated with leptin or control buffer in order to identify the protein expression changes as the potential targets of leptin. Mice were treated with either phosphate-buffered saline (control) or 10 µg/day leptin for 14 days via subcutaneous osmotic minipumps. Total protein from white adipose tissue was extracted and labeled with different fluorescent cyanine dyes for analysis by two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). Spots that were differentially expressed and appeared to have sufficient material for mass spectrometry analysis were picked and digested with trypsin and subjected to MALDI-TOF MS for protein identification. Twelve functional protein groups were found differentially expressed in adipose tissue of leptin-treated vs. control ob/ob mice, including molecular chaperones and redox proteins such as calreticulin (CALR), protein disulfide isomerase-associated 3 (PDIA3), prohibitin (PHB), and peroxiredoxin-6 (PRDX6); cytoskeleton proteins such as β actin, desmin, and α-tubulin; and some other proteins. The mRNA levels of CALR, PDIA3, and PHB were measured by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and found to be upregulated (P < 0.05), consistent with the fold change in protein expression level. Our findings suggest that leptin's effects on lipid metabolism and apoptosis may be mediated in part by alterations in expression of molecular chaperones and redox proteins for regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and cytoskeleton proteins for regulating mitochondrial morphology.",,,"Adipose Tissue, Animals, Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Leptin, Lipid Metabolism, Mice, Mice, Obese, Obesity, Prohibitins, RNA, Messenger, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Two-Dimensional Difference Gel Electrophoresis",,

20578032,In vivo observation of the locomotion of microglial cells in the retina.,"Microglial cells (MCs) are active sensors and reactive phagocytes of neural tissues. They are known to migrate and accumulate in areas of neuronal damage. Thus, microglial locomotion is an essential feature of the inflammatory reaction in neural tissue. Yet, to our knowledge there has been no report of direct in vivo observation of the migration of MCs. Here, we show that intravitreally injected cyanine dyes (DiO, DiI, and indocyanine green) are sequestrated in MCs during several months, and subsequently in vivo images of these fluorescent MCs can be obtained by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy. This enabled noninvasive, time-lapse observation of the migrating behavior of MCs, both in the basal state and following laser damage. In the basal state, a slow, intermittent, random-like locomotion was observed. Following focal laser damage, MCs promptly (i.e., within 1 h) initiated centripetal, convergent migration. MCs up to 400 μm away migrated into the scar at velocities up to 7 μm/min. This early phase of centripetal migration was followed by a more prolonged phase of nontargeted locomotion around and within injured sites during at least 24 h. Cyanine-positive cells persisted within the scar during several weeks. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo observation of the locomotion of individual MCs. Our results show that the locomotion of MCs is not limited to translocation to acutely damaged area, but may also be observed in the basal state and after completion of the recruitment of MCs into scars.",,,"Animals, Cell Movement, Fluorescent Dyes, Male, Mice, Mice, Transgenic, Microglia, Microscopy, Confocal, Rats, Rats, Long-Evans, Retina, Staining and Labeling",,

Based on the analysis of both calculations and experimental data obtained from absorption and (13)C NMR spectra, it was concluded that the 2-azaazulene residue can be treated as a weakly basic terminal group; its donor properties are provided with the participation of the HOMO-1, in contrast to the typical Brooker's terminal residues with their donor HOMOs. The new classification of the terminal groups of cyanine dyes, and hence the classification of types of unsymmetrical cyanines, is proposed. It is shown that the nature of the higher electron transitions (delocalized or local) in the cyanine dyes depends on their type. In the unsymmetrical trimethine cyanine of the mixed type, negative deviations are observed in their absorption spectra.",,,,,

20449035,Photoinduced hole-transfer in semiconducting polymer/low-bandgap cyanine dye blends: evidence for unit charge separation quantum yield.,"Power-conversion efficiencies of organic heterojunction solar cells can be increased by using semiconducting donor-acceptor materials with complementary absorption spectra extending to the near-infrared region. Here, we used continuous wave fluorescence and absorption, as well as nanosecond transient absorption spectroscopy to study the initial charge transfer step for blends of a donor poly(p-phenylenevinylene) derivative and low-band gap cyanine dyes serving as electron acceptors. Electron transfer is the dominant relaxation process after photoexcitation of the donor. Hole transfer after cyanine photoexcitation occurs with an efficiency close to unity up to dye concentrations of approximately 30 wt%. Cyanines present an efficient self-quenching mechanism of their fluorescence, and for higher dye loadings in the blend, or pure cyanine films, this process effectively reduces the hole transfer. Comparison between dye emission in an inert polystyrene matrix and the donor matrix allowed us to separate the influence of self-quenching and charge transfer mechanisms. Favorable photovoltaic bilayer performance, including high open-circuit voltages of approximately 1 V confirmed the results from optical experiments. The characteristics of solar cells using different dyes also highlighted the need for balanced adjustment of the energy levels and their offsets at the heterojunction when using low-bandgap materials, and accentuated important effects of interface interactions and solid-state packing on charge generation and transport.",,,"Carbocyanines, Molecular Structure, Photons, Polyvinyls, Quantum Theory, Semiconductors",,
20442922,Photoswitching of monomeric and dimeric DNA-intercalating cyanine dyes for super-resolution microscopy applications.,"A growing trend in far-field super resolution fluorescence microscopy based on single molecule photoswitching involves the replacement of photoactivatable fluorophores by common organic dyes in which photoswitching reactions or blinking can be induced. This alternative strategy can greatly simplify the sample preparation and imaging scheme in some cases, and enables its application to a wider range of biological systems. This methodology has been applied successfully to unveil the nanoscale organisation of proteins, but little progress has been seen to date in DNA super-resolution imaging. Previous results have shown that blinking can be induced in the DNA-intercalating dimeric dye YOYO-1 in combination with a reducing buffer, and in turn super-resolution images of DNA can be reconstructed. However, monomeric intercalating dyes like YO-PRO-1 are more advantageous for biological applications. This paper shows that both YO-PRO-1 and YOYO-1 can be used in super-resolution imaging, and different sample preparation strategies are compared in terms of spatial resolution and homogeneity of the reconstructed super-resolution images. Moreover, ensemble and single-molecule experiments provide insight into the switching mechanism. The dyes YOYO-1 and YO-PRO-1 hold great potential for their use in nanoscale imaging of DNA topology in biology and nanoscience.",,,"Benzoxazoles, Carbocyanines, DNA, Dimerization, Fluorescent Dyes, Intercalating Agents, Light, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Photochemistry, Quinolinium Compounds",,

In this study, we show the preferential uptake and retention of two hepatamethine cyanine dyes, IR-783 and MHI-148, in tumor cells and tissues. IR-783 and MHI-148 were investigated for their ability to accumulate in human cancer cells, tumor xenografts, and spontaneous mouse tumors in transgenic animals. Time- and concentration-dependent dye uptake and retention in normal and cancer cells and tissues were compared, and subcellular localization of the dyes and mechanisms of the dye uptake and retention in tumor cells were evaluated using organelle-specific tracking dyes and bromosulfophthalein, a competitive inhibitor of organic anion transporting peptides. These dyes were used to detect human cancer metastases in a mouse model and differentiate cancer cells from normal cells in blood. These near-IR hepatamethine cyanine dyes were retained in cancer cells but not normal cells, in tumor xenografts, and in spontaneous tumors in transgenic mice. They can be used to detect cancer metastasis and cancer cells in blood with a high degree of sensitivity. The dyes were found to concentrate in the mitochondria and lysosomes of cancer cells, probably through organic anion transporting peptides, because the dye uptake and retention in cancer cells can be blocked completely by bromosulfophthalein. These dyes, when injected to mice, did not cause systemic toxicity. These two heptamethine cyanine dyes are promising imaging agents for human cancers and can be further exploited to improve cancer detection, prognosis, and treatment.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Diagnostic Imaging, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Mice, Mice, Nude, Neoplasms, Experimental, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Transplantation, Heterologous",,
20403457,SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II are not mutagenic in the Ames test.,"Favorable photo-physical properties and high affinity to nucleic acids make new fluorescent cyanine dyes of the SYBR-type particularly useful for DNA and RNA visualization. The growing popularity of SYBR-type dyes is also explained by the fact that removal of the dye from the nucleic acids by ethanol precipitation is more efficient and less time-consuming than the phenol-chloroform extraction applied for the widely used phenanthridine DNA stain, ethidium bromide. To evaluate the safety of nucleic acid staining by SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II we compared the mutagenicity of these compounds, with characteristics corresponding to those of ethidium bromide, by use of the Salmonella/mammalian microsome reverse-mutation assays (Ames test). SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold did not show mutagenicity either in frame-shift or in base-substitution indicator strains, TA98 and TA100, respectively. These results were observed both in the presence and in the absence of supernatant from a rat-liver homogenate S9. Mutagenicity of these stains was not observed although their toxic concentration was reached. Toxic effects of SYBR Green II and SYBR Gold were seen approximately at the same molar concentrations as reported previously for SYBR Green I. As expected, ethidium bromide revealed strong mutagenicity with a maximum increase of 60-fold above the vehicle controls in the frame-shift indicator strain TA98 in the presence of rat-liver S9 extract. Thus, SYBR Gold and SYBR Green II do not show mutagenicity in our tests, even at toxic doses, and these DNA stains represent safer alternatives to ethidium bromide for nucleic acid visualization.",,,"Ethidium, Fluorescent Dyes, Mutagenicity Tests, Mutagens, Organic Chemicals, Salmonella typhimurium",,
20345124,DNA photocleavage by DNA and DNA-LNA amino acid-dye conjugates.,"DNA photocleavage by triplex forming oligonucleotides (TFO) has potential implications in both biotechnology and medicine. We have synthesized a series of homopurine DNA and DNA/LNA 14-mers to which an amino acid (glycine or l-tryptophan) and a cyanine dye are covalently linked. Two cyanine dyes were examined that include a quinolinium ring linked to a benzothiazolium ring through a monomethine (TO1) or trimethine (TO2) linker. The 14-mer sequence was chosen to target mdm2, a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that regulates p53 by promoting its ubiquitylation and proteosomal degradation. Such inhibition has been previously proposed as a therapeutic approach to target wild-type p53-expressing cancers. To examine whether our TFO conjugates photocleave the mdm2 target, we incubated the various conjugates with the mdm2 plasmid and irradiated the samples with visible light. We show that only the TFO with the complementary sequence and with an intervening l-tryptophan leads to the linearization of the plasmid after a short irradiation time (10 min) exciting the dye (lambda(max)(TO1) = 500 nm and lambda(max)(TO2) = 630 nm) with visible light. Furthermore, the photoreactivity is more pronounced for the LNA/DNA conjugate, an observation that is consistent with improved hybridization to the DNA target. Sequence specificity of the photoreaction is further corroborated on a synthetic 44-mer duplex containing the TFO site. Evidence for a ROS-dependent mechanism is also given and discussed.",,,"Amino Acids, Carbocyanines, DNA, DNA Cleavage, Light, Oligonucleotides, Oxygen, Photochemistry, Plasmids",,

20213243,"Behaviour of fluorescence emission of cyanine dyes, cyanine based fluorescent nanoparticles and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots in water solution upon specific thermal treatments.","Fluorescence techniques are widely used as detection methods in a wide range of biological imaging and analytical applications. The purpose of this work is to determine a measurement method which leads to a comparison between different classes of fluorophores in term of stability of the fluorescence signal upon thermal treatment cycles. This kind of investigation can determine whether the fluorophore performance is affected by heating/cooling cycles and to what extent. The fluorophores considered in this work were organic fluorophores belonging to the family of indocyanine dyes (IRIS3 by Cyanine Technologies S.p.A.) in their molecular form or encapsulated within silica nanoparticles, and CdSe/ZnS carboxyl quantum dots (Qdots 565 ITK by Invitrogen). The NIST Standard Reference Material® SRM 1932 fluorescein solution was used in the certified concentration as reference material in order to evaluate the repeatability of the used spectrofluorimeter. The proposed measurement protocol allows to characterize all kind of fluorophores upon thermal treatments. This allows direct comparison of their performance under temperature changes, giving useful guidelines for the selection of the most suitable fluorophore for the envisaged application. Moreover the method appears to be a promising tool for the characterisation of reference fluorescent materials. The experimental results demonstrate that each fluorophore class shows a specific behaviour. The experimental data analysis points out an important hysteresis effect for quantum dots that was not detected for cyanine molecules and was only slightly detected for cyanine doped silica nanoparticles.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Hot Temperature, Methods, Nanoparticles, Quantum Dots, Silicon Dioxide, Solutions, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Temperature",,
20201514,Continuous symmetry breaking induced by ion pairing effect in heptamethine cyanine dyes: beyond the cyanine limit.,"The association of heptamethine cyanine cation 1(+) with various counterions A (A = Br(-), I(-), PF(6)(-), SbF(6)(-), B(C(6)F(5))(4)(-), TRISPHAT) was realized. The six different ion pairs have been characterized by X-ray diffraction, and their absorption properties were studied in polar (DCM) and apolar (toluene) solvents. A small, hard anion (Br(-)) is able to strongly polarize the polymethine chain, resulting in the stabilization of an asymmetric dipolar-like structure in the crystal and in nondissociating solvents. On the contrary, in more polar solvents or when it is associated with a bulky soft anion (TRISPHAT or B(C(6)F(5))(4)(-)), the same cyanine dye adopts preferentially the ideal polymethine state. The solid-state and solution absorption properties of heptamethine dyes are therefore strongly correlated to the nature of the counterion.",,,,,
20155959,TDDFT study of the optical properties of Cy5 and its derivatives.,"Cyanine dyes which show a very strong pi-pi* type electronic absorption have attracted attention as active components for optoelectronic applications. In the present study, the optical properties of Cy5 and Cy5-X (X = F, Cl, Br, and I) have been theoretically explored by applying the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method. The geometries of the ground state of the studied models have been fully optimized at the B3LYP/LanL2DZ and B3LYP/SDD levels of theory. Based upon the optimized structures of the ground state, the TDDFT calculations were performed to compute the vertical singlet excitation energies and the absorption spectra of the studied species. Compared with the optical properties of Cy5, halogen ions lower the vertical excitation energies and cause the maximum absorption wavelength to be red-shifted for the Cy5-X derivatives. By employing the polarizable continuum model (PCM) approach for all the gas-phase-optimized structures, the influence of solvent effects on the spectra of Cy5 and Cy5-X was considered in three solvents (ethanol, DMSO, and water). The obtained results suggest that the solvents may lower the excitation energy of Cy5. However, for the Cy5-X species the excitation energies are higher in solvents than in the gas phase.",,,,,
20146347,Polylactide nanoparticles containing stably incorporated cyanine dyes for in vitro and in vivo imaging applications.,"Stably incorporating fluorescent molecules to polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) or micelles can facilitate the prolonged tracking of these drug-delivery vehicles in vitro and in vivo. However, incorporation of fluorescent molecules, usually charged and thereby water-soluble, through the encapsulation strategy to hydrophobic polymer matrices is challenging. The encapsulated fluorescent agents are also subject to rapid release when the polymeric NPs are exposed to biological media. To address this issue, we developed Cy5-conjugated polylactide (Cy5-PLA) NPs through Cy5/(BDI)ZnN(TMS)2 [(BDI) = 2-((2,6-diisopropylphenyl)amido)-4-((2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-imino)-2-pentene]-mediated ring-opening polymerization of lactide (LA) followed by nanoprecipitation. This process allows for covalent conjugation of Cy5 to PLA with quantitative incorporation efficiency and formulation of Cy5-PLA NPs with controlled particles size (approximately 100 nm). As much as 80% of Cy5 was still present in the Cy5-PLA NPs after theses NPs were incubated in PBS at 37 degrees C for 12 days. Cy5-PLA NPs were conjugated to the A10 RNA aptamer that binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). The resulting Cy5-PLA/aptamer NPs were found to only bind to and get internalized by LNCaP and canine prostate adenocarcinoma cells (PSMA-positive), but not to PC3 cells (PSMA-negative). The Cy5-PLA NPs were administered to balb/c mice intravenously and found to have excellent signals with low-background fluorescence in various organs.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Dogs, Drug Carriers, Drug Delivery Systems, Female, Fluorescent Dyes, Glutamate Carboxypeptidase II, Humans, Kinetics, Mice, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Nanoparticles, Particle Size, Polyesters",,
20136129,Development and application of a near-infrared fluorescence probe for oxidative stress based on differential reactivity of linked cyanine dyes.,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) operate as signaling molecules under various physiological conditions, and overproduction of ROS is involved in the pathogenesis of many diseases. Therefore, fluorescent probes for visualizing ROS are promising tools with which to uncover the molecular mechanisms of physiological and pathological processes and might also be useful for diagnosis. Here we describe a novel fluorescence probe, FOSCY-1, operating in the physiologically favorable near-infrared region. The probe consists of two differentially ROS-reactive cyanine dyes connected by a linker; reaction of the more susceptible dye with ROS releases intramolecular fluorescence quenching of the less susceptible dye. We successfully applied this probe to detect ROS produced by HL60 cells and porcine neutrophils and for imaging oxidative stress in a mouse model of peritonitis.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Neutrophils, Oxidative Stress, Peritonitis, Reactive Oxygen Species, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared, Swine",,
20088807,Disaggregation of tau as a therapeutic approach to tauopathies.,"Tau aggregation is an appealing target for therapeutic intervention. However, conformational change or aggregation needs to be targeted without inhibiting the normal biology of tau and its role in microtubule stabilization. The number of compound classes being tested at this time are very limited and include Congo red derivatives [2], anthraquinones (Pickhardt et al. 2005 [3], disputed in Crowe et al. 2007 [4]), 2,3-di(furan-2-yl)-quinoxalines , phenylthiazolyl-hydrazide (PTH) [5], polyphenols and porphyrins [6] and cyanine dyes [1, 7, 8]. Herein we have utilized a member of the cyanine dye family (C11) in an organotypic slice culture model of tangle formation. Our results demonstrate that C11 is capable of affecting tau polymerization in a biphasic, dose dependent manner. At submicromolar concentrations (0.001 microM) C11 reduced levels of aggregated tau. However, higher doses resulted in an increase in tau polymerization. These effects can also be seen at the level of individual filaments with changes in filament length and number mirroring the pattern seen via immunoblotting. In addition, this effect is achieved without altering levels of phosphorylation at disease and microtubule binding relevant epitopes.",,,"Animals, Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Evaluation, Preclinical, Mice, Microtubules, Neurofibrillary Tangles, Organ Culture Techniques, Polymers, Structure-Activity Relationship, Tauopathies, tau Proteins",,
20073528,"Fast assembly of cyanine dyes into aggregates onto [6,6]-phenyl C61-butyric acid methyl ester surfaces from organic solvents.","Supramolecular agglomerates of organic colorants based on noncovalent interactions are promising candidates for the development of sensors, optoelectronics, lighting, or photovoltaics. However, their fast and defect-free fabrication on large scales using low-cost technologies has proven elusive so far. Here, we introduce a so far unreported mechanism to induce molecular order in cyanine dyes within minutes from organic solvents by self-assembly. Spin coating blends of a cyanine dye and a soluble fullerene derivative ([6,6]-phenyl C(61)-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)) from apolar, aprotic solvents leads to phase-separated structures on the micrometer scale. With this superordinated phase structure, adjustment of dye aggregation is possible, leading to novel optical properties of the film emerging from dye self-assembly on the nanometer scale. In the primary process, semiporous PCBM domains act as nucleation sites for H-aggregates. H-aggregates can then be reconstructed into J-aggregates by dissolving PCBM from the film. Unexpectedly, the method even works for sterically hindered cyanine dyes that are known for their reduced tendency to aggregate. Additionally, selective removal of H-aggregates leaves a template of PCBM nanocrystals, onto which cyanine dye monomers readsorb from solution, forming H-aggregates of similar quality.",,,,,
20055680,Superresolution imaging using single-molecule localization.,"Superresolution imaging is a rapidly emerging new field of microscopy that dramatically improves the spatial resolution of light microscopy by over an order of magnitude (approximately 10-20-nm resolution), allowing biological processes to be described at the molecular scale. Here, we discuss a form of superresolution microscopy based on the controlled activation and sampling of sparse subsets of photoconvertible fluorescent molecules. In this single-molecule-based imaging approach, a wide variety of probes have proved valuable, ranging from genetically encodable photoactivatable fluorescent proteins to photoswitchable cyanine dyes. These have been used in diverse applications of superresolution imaging: from three-dimensional, multicolor molecule localization to tracking of nanometric structures and molecules in living cells. Single-molecule-based superresolution imaging thus offers exciting possibilities for obtaining molecular-scale information on biological events occurring at variable timescales.",,,"Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted, Luminescent Proteins, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Microscopy, Polarization",,

Herein, we report the use of microwave assisted organic synthesis of five NIR cyanine dyes in yields ranging from 64-83% with a significant reduction in solvent use.

20016664,Fluorescence lifetime properties of near-infrared cyanine dyes in relation to their structures.,"Structurally diverse near-infrared (NIR) absorbing polymethine dyes were prepared and their fluorescence lifetimes (FLT) were evaluated in relation to their structural features. Comparative FLT analysis based on the modification of methine chain length and heterocyclic system showed that indolium or benz[e]indolium heptamethine dyes exhibited longer FLT than the benz[c,d]indolium trimethine dye. Modification of heterocyclic system alone with an intact chain length showed that indolium-based heptamethine dyes showed approximately 30% longer FLT than the benz[e]indolium-based dyes. In general, the FLT of polymethine dyes increased from polar to non-polar solvents. In addition, correlation study between the theoretical and the experimental FLT for indocyanine green (ICG) suggests that the lack of structural rigidity for these cyanine dyes is primarily responsible for the loss of the excited state energy via non-radiative pathway.",,,,,
19961226,Photoswitching mechanism of cyanine dyes.,"Cyanine dyes have been shown to undergo reversible photoswitching, where the fluorophore can be switched between a fluorescent state and a dark state upon illumination at different wavelengths. The photochemical mechanism by which switching occurs has yet to be elucidated. In this study, we have determined the mechanism of photoswitching by characterizing the kinetics of dark state formation and the spectral and structural properties of the dark state. The rate of switching to the dark state depends on the concentration of the primary thiol in the solution and the solution pH in a manner quantitatively consistent with the formation of an encounter complex between the cyanine dye and ionized thiol prior to their conjugation. Mass spectrometry suggests that the photoconversion product is a thiol-cyanine adduct in which covalent attachment of the thiol to the polymethine bridge disrupts the original conjugated pi-electron system of the dye.",,,"Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Electrons, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Kinetics, Light, Mass Spectrometry, Photochemical Processes, Sulfhydryl Compounds",,

19924998,Dye sensitization of single crystal semiconductor electrodes.,"Even though investigations of dye-sensitized nanocrystalline semiconductors in solar cells has dominated research on dye-sensitized semiconductors over the past two decades, single crystal electrodes represent far simpler model systems for studying the sensitization process with a continuing train of studies dating back more than 40 years. Even today single crystal surfaces prove to be more controlled experimental models for the study of dye-sensitized semiconductors than the nanocrystalline substrates. This Account analyzes the scientific advances in the model sensitized single crystal systems that preceded the introduction of nanocrystalline semiconductor electrodes. It then follows the single crystal research to the present, illustrating both their striking simplicity of use and clarity of interpretation relative to nanocrystalline electrodes. Researchers have employed many electrochemical, photochemical, and scanning probe techniques for studying monolayer quantities of sensitizing dyes at specific crystallographic faces of different semiconductors. These methods include photochronocoulometry, electronic spectroscopy, and flash photolysis of dyes at potential-controlled semiconductor electrodes and the use of total internal reflection methods. In addition, we describe the preparation of surfaces of single crystal SnS(2) and TiO(2) electrodes to serve as reproducible model systems for charge separation at dye-sensitized solar cells. This process involves cleaving the SnS(2) electrodes and a photoelectrochemical surface treatment for TiO(2) that produces clean surfaces for sensitization (as verified by AFM) resulting in near unity yields for electron transfer from the molecular excited dyes into the conduction band. In recent experiments with ruthenium complexes at TiO(2) and with carboxylated cyanine dyes, we demonstrate the promise of this simple model for understanding dye-sensitized solar cells. In each of these systems, we can observe and analyze the complex photochemistry in a quantitative manner. Molecules of the well-known N3 ruthenium complex attach to four different crystallographic faces of anatase and rutile TiO(2) at different rates and to a different extent. With carboxylated cyanine dye sensitizers on these surfaces, molecular aggregation on the surface is a function of molecular structure and crystallographic face. In contrast with the N3 sensitizer these organic dyes undergo a photoinduced dimerization and desorption reaction when hydroquinone regenerators are present. With both classes of sensitizers, we demonstrate a new photochronocoulometric technique that quantifies the amount of attached dye on the electrode surface. We have completed initial experiments examining quantum dot sensitization of TiO(2) crystals, which could eventually lead to sensitizers with higher stability and absorption coefficients. Although these single crystal electrode models show promise for providing insights and predictive value in understanding the sensitization process, more sophisticated models will be needed to fully understand the charge transfer from the localized electronic states of the sensitizer to the extended states of the semiconductor.",,,,,
19911952,Validation of self-made fluorescent cyanine dyes for 2D gel-based multi-fluorescence protein analysis.,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) in combination with quantitative multi-fluorescence protein analysis (MFA) is the most versatile methodical tool for differential analysis of protein mixtures or even complex proteomes. It is based on covalent labelling of proteins with fluorescent cyanine dyes (Ethyl-Cy2, Propyl-Cy3 or Methyl-Cy5) before isoelectric focussing, enabling differential tagging of up to three samples which are finally separated on the same 2-D gel. To minimize costs and to increase the number of possible experiments, the cyanine dye NHS esters were synthesized in our own lab according to a protocol published by Jung and Kim (2006) . Self-made cyanine dyes were tested by studying their labelling and fluorescent properties and possible effects on the electrophoretic mobility of labelled proteins. To validate the potential use as labels in 2-DE/MFA experiments, dyes were used for the differential analysis of the proteome of thrombin-stimulated human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs).",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cells, Cultured, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Liver, Mice, Myocytes, Smooth Muscle, Proteins, Proteome, Thrombin, Veins",,
19895107,Cyanine-loaded lipid nanoparticles for improved in vivo fluorescence imaging.,"Fluorescence is a very promising radioactive-free technique for functional imaging in small animals and, in the future, in humans. However, most commercial near-infrared dyes display poor optical properties, such as low fluorescence quantum yields and short fluorescence lifetimes. In this paper, we explore whether the encapsulation of infrared cyanine dyes within the core of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) could improve their optical properties. Lipophilic dialkylcarbocyanines DiD and DiR are loaded very efficiently in 30-35-nm-diam lipid droplets stabilized in water by surfactants. No significant fluorescence autoquenching is observed up to 53 dyes per particle. Encapsulated in LNP, which are stable for more than one year at room temperature in HBS buffer (HEPES 0.02 M, EDTA 0.01 M, pH 5.5), DiD and DiR display far improved fluorescence quantum yields Phi (respectively, 0.38 and 0.25) and longer fluorescence lifetimes tau (respectively, 1.8 and 1.1 ns) in comparison to their hydrophilic counterparts Cy5 (Phi=0.28, tau=1.0 ns) and Cy7 (Phi=0.13, tau=0.57 ns). Moreover, dye-loaded LNPs are able to accumulate passively in various subcutaneous tumors in mice, thanks to the enhanced permeability and retention effect.

Onco-proteomics thus has the ability to revolutionize oncology practice by delivering highly selective and individualised clinical care. One of the proteomic techniques, two-dimensional (2D) difference in gel electrophoresis (DIGE) enables simultaneous examination and comparison of multiple samples using cyanine dyes to label amino acid residues that are then separated based on charge and mass. This technique reduces variability, improves reproducibility, and allows easier quantitation when compared with traditional 2D polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).

19874263,Modulation and detection of tau aggregation with small-molecule ligands.,"Recent results from high-throughput and other screening approaches reveal that small molecules can directly interact with recombinant full-length tau monomers and fibrillar tau aggregates in three distinct modes. First, in the high concentration regime (>10 micromolar), certain anionic molecules such as Congo red efficiently promote tau filament formation through a nucleation-elongation mechanism involving a dimeric nucleus and monomer-mediated elongation. These compounds are useful for modeling tau aggregation in vitro and in biological models. Second, in the low concentration regime (<1 micromolar), other ligands, including cyanine dyes, display aggregation antagonist activity. Compounds that can prevent or reverse fibrillization are candidate modifiers of disease pathology. Finally, certain compounds bind mature tau fibrils with varying affinities at multiple binding sites without modulating the aggregation reaction. For some ligands, >10-fold selectivity for tau aggregates relative to filaments composed of beta-amyloid or alpha-synuclein can be demonstrated at the level of binding affinity. Together these observations suggest that small-molecules have utility for interrogating the tau aggregation pathway, for inhibiting neuritic lesion formation, and for selective pre-mortem detection of neurofibrillary lesions through whole brain imaging.",,,"Alzheimer Disease, Brain, Humans, Methylene Blue, Neurofibrillary Tangles, tau Proteins",,

However, many applications require immobilization of these nanostructures on a solid substrate, which is a challenge to achieve without destroying their delicate supramolecular structure. Here, we use a drop-flow technique to immobilize double-walled tubular J-aggregates of amphiphilic cyanine dyes without affecting their morphological or optical properties. High-resolution images of the topography and exciton fluorescence of individual J-aggregates are obtained simultaneously with polarization-resolved near-field scanning optical microscopy. These images show remarkably uniform supramolecular structure, both along individual nanotubes and between nanotubes in an ensemble, demonstrating their potential for light harvesting and energy transport.",,,,,

Of particular interest are dendrimers, monoatomic steps on terraced silver halide microcrystals and fullerene derivatives as nucleating surfaces. Molecular organisation into J-aggregates by self-assembly was realized using aprotic, apolar solvents for fullerenes, and polar solvents for dendrimers and monoatomic surface steps. By using dendrimers as nucleating agents in mesopores of metal oxide nanoparticle coatings, size-controlled and stable J-aggregates with high optical densities and strong fluorescence were obtained reproducibly.

We exploited a previously reported promiscuous binding interaction between a single-chain, variable fragment antibody protein and a family of cyanine dyes to create new protein-dye fluoromodules that exhibit enhanced photostability while retaining high affinity protein-dye binding. Modifications to the dye structure included electron-withdrawing groups that provide resistance to photo-oxidative damage.

Specifically, a method to generate donor (CbOH)-acceptor (Me2NCp) near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent dye pairs for preparing enzyme activatable molecular systems were developed based on the structural template of heptamethine cyanine dyes. Using caspase-3 as a model enzyme, we prepared two new caspase-3 sensitive compounds with high fluorescence quenching efficiency: Me2NCp-DEVD-K(CbOH)-OH (4) and AcGK(Me2NCp)-DEVD-APK(CbOH)-NH2 (5). The mechanism of quenching was based on combined effects of direct (classical) and reverse fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Caspase-3 cleavage of the scissile DEVD amide bond regenerated the NIR fluorescence of both donor and acceptor dyes. While both compounds were cleaved by caspase-3, substrate 5 was cleaved more readily than 4, yielding k(cat) and K(M), values of 1.02 +/- 0.06 s(-1) and 15 +/- 3 microM, respectively. Treatment of A549 tumor cells with paclitaxel resulted in > 2-fold increase in the fluorescence intensity by NIR confocal microscopy, suggesting the activation of pro-caspase-3 to caspase-3. A similar trend was observed in a mouse model, where the fluorescence intensity was nearly twice the value in caspase-3-rich tissue relative to the control. These results demonstrate the use of the same NIR activatable molecular systems for monitoring the activities of enzymes across a wide spatial scale ranging from in vitro kinetics measurements to in cellulo and in vivo localization of caspase-3 activation. The NIR activatable molecular probes provide an effective strategy to screen new drugs in vitro and monitor treatment response in living organisms.",,,"Animals, Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic, Caspase 3, Enzyme Activation, Fluorescence, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Kinetics, Lung Neoplasms, Male, Mice, Microscopy, Fluorescence, Models, Molecular, Paclitaxel, Tumor Cells, Cultured",,

We found that the partial wave approximation with semiempirical corrections for excluded volume and hydrogen bonding effects provides estimations of the binding and dimerization energies of the aggregates, which are in agreement with available experimental data.

19706146,The calculated ionization potential and electron affinity of cationic cyanine dyes.,"The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity (EA) of the isolated single dye molecule and a hypothetical isolated J-aggregated dimer are calculated as an energy difference between separately minimized ground and ionized states. Three quantum methods are employed: density functional theory (DFT) Gaussian03 B3LYP/6-311G** (++G**); DFT using Dmol(3); and a modification of CNDO/S, called CNDO/S-Deltazeta, which is developed for rapid calculation of the IP and EA. Results indicate that for the monomer, 1,1'-dimethyl-2,2'carbocyanine chloride, the vertical IP and EA are 6.2 +/- 0.1 and 1.90 +/- 0.05 eV, respectively. This is consistent with the threshold IP and EA predicted by the Yianoulis and Nelson ""Statistical Model"" of spectral sensitization. For the isolated J-aggregated dimer, whose configuration is consistent with being adsorbed on a dielectric substrate, the calculations predict a value of 5.2 +/- 0.2 and 2.35 +/- 0.05 eV for the IP and EA, respectively. Significant charge density is removed from the halide anion in the ionization process. The HOMO of the dye molecule is an MO associated with the halide anion. Calculation of the isolated entities is a necessary preliminary step in the study of the IP and EA of the adsorbed dye monomer and aggregate.",,,"Carbocyanines, Cations, Electrons, Models, Molecular, Quantum Theory",,
19655781,Synthesis and spectroscopic studies of composite gold nanorods with a double-shell structure composed of spacer and cyanine dye J-aggregate layers.,"The composite gold nanorods (Au NRs) having a double-shell structure composed of Au NR (core), spacer layer (inner shell), and J-aggregate (JA) layer (outer shell) have been synthesized to examine the spectroscopic properties of the hybrid system in which the localized surface plasmon is coupled with the molecular exciton of JA. The spacer layer consisting of N,N,N-trimethyl(11-mercaptoundecyl)ammonium chloride plays a significant role in the formation of JA shell for several kinds of cyanine dyes. The absorption spectra of composite NRs are characterized by a distinct dip near the J-band when the plasmon energy of Au core is close to the exciton energy of JA shell, whereas a normal J-band peak appears when two energies are widely different from each other. The gradual change from the dip type to peak type absorption was observed when the plasmon energy was modulated by varying the aspect ratio of Au NR. Furthermore, composite NRs with thicker spacer layers have been fabricated by inserting the multilayer shell of polyelectrolytes between TMA and JA layers. They exhibited an alteration of the spectral line shape from the dip type to peak type with increase in the thickness of spacer layer. These observations have been interpreted in terms of the strength of the exciton-plasmon coupling, which is sensitive to the configuration of composite NRs as well as the relative difference between plasmon and exciton energies.",,,,,
19639111,DNA sequence-dependent enhancement of Cy3 fluorescence.,"Cyanine dyes are extensively used as fluorescent probes in molecular biology, biochemical and biophysical applications. We investigated the fluorescent properties of Cy3 covalently attached to the 5' terminus of DNA oligonucleotides, and demonstrated that its fluorescence efficiency and lifetime depend strongly on DNA sequence. DNA sequence determines the extent and nature of the interactions between the dye and the DNA bases, which are responsible for the unusual enhancement in fluorescence observed for a large number of oligonucleotides. Results are discussed in terms of a photoisomerization mechanism that deactivates the excited state and thus competes with fluorescence. The efficiency of isomerization decreases when Cy3-DNA interactions prevent rotation around the double bonds, resulting in an increase in the lifetime of the singlet excited state. We have shown that the ability of Cy3 to interact with DNA depends on the flexibility of the oligonucleotide and the presence of purines in the chain.",,,"Base Sequence, Carbocyanines, DNA, Single-Stranded, Fluorescence",,
19617766,An assessment of bacterial dysbiosis in pouchitis using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms of 16S ribosomal DNA from pouch effluent microbiota.,"Previous studies on dysbiosis and pouchitis using conventional culture techniques have been disappointing because of inherent limitations associated with the technique. This study was designed to use terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism to evaluate patients with and without pouchitis. Bacterial microbiota in 20 pouch patients (15 healthy and 5 with inflamed) were studied. DNA was extracted from feces, and polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers (V6-V8 region) that were modified at the 5' end with cyanine dyes. Amplicons were digested with merozoite surface protein-1 enzyme. The restricted fragments were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis, and the electrophenograms were studied. Electrophenograms provide information about operational taxonomic units, which correspond to specific organisms. Principal component analysis was performed to identify dominant and important operational taxonomic units in the 20 patients. Bacterial diversity and counts of these operational taxonomic units were compared in the two groups of patients. Total bacterial diversity in patients with pouchitis was similar to that in patients with healthy pouches (16 (11-20) vs. 12 (9-13), P = 0.279). Using principal component analysis, 29 operational taxonomic units were found to be important. Bacterial counts of seven dominant organisms (operational taxonomic unit 79 (enterococci), 85 (Pantoea), 88 (Enterobacteriaceae), 90 (eubacteria), 91 (Pseudomonas), 146 (clostridia), and 148 (bacilli)) were similar in patients with pouchitis and those with a healthy pouch (P > 0.05). Seventeen (operational taxonomic unit 73 (Leptospira), 93 (Pseudoalteromonas), 96, 100 (Desulfosporosinus), 114, 121, 134, 137, 141 (Microcystis), 159, 174 (Methylobacter), 193 (uncultured proteobacteria), 232, 376, 381, 414, and 465) of the remaining 22 nondominant organisms were seen exclusively in patients with pouchitis. The majority of these organisms were novel.

19478088,Inhibition of tau polymerization with a cyanine dye in two distinct model systems.,"In a host of neurodegenerative diseases Tau, a microtubule-associated protein, aggregates into insoluble lesions within neurons. Previous studies have utilized cyanine dyes as Tau aggregation inhibitors in vitro. Herein we utilize cyanine dye 3,3'-diethyl-9-methyl-thiacarbocyanine iodide (C11) to modulate Tau polymerization in two model systems, an organotypic slice culture model derived from Tau transgenic mice and a split green fluorescent protein complementation assay in Tau-expressing cells. In slice cultures, submicromolar concentrations (0.001 microm) of C11 produced a significant reduction of aggregated Tau and a corresponding increase in unpolymerized Tau. In contrast, treatment with a 1 microm dose promoted aggregation of Tau. These results were recapitulated in the complementation assay where administration of 1 microm C11 produced a significant increase in polymerized Tau relative to control, whereas treatment of cells with 0.01 microm C11 resulted in a marked reduction of aggregated Tau. In the organotypic slice cultures, modulation of Tau aggregation was independent of changes in phosphorylation at disease and microtubule binding relevant epitopes for both dosing regimes. Furthermore, treatment with 0.001 microm C11 resulted in a decrease in both total filament mass and number. There was no evidence of apoptosis or loss of synaptic integrity at either dose, however, whereas submicromolar concentrations of C11 did not interfere with microtubule binding, higher doses resulted in a decrease in the levels of microtubule-bound Tau. Overall, a cyanine dye can dissociate aggregated Tau in an ex vivo model of tauopathy with little toxicity and exploration of the use of these type of dyes as therapeutic agents is warranted.",,,"Animals, Biological Assay, Biopolymers, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Endocytosis, Green Fluorescent Proteins, Humans, Mice, Microtubules, Phosphorylation, Tissue Culture Techniques, Tissue Survival, Transfection, tau Proteins",,
19402091,Controlling the formation of cyanine dye H- and J-aggregates with cucurbituril hosts in the presence of anionic polyelectrolytes.,"The presence of anionic polyelectrolytes enhances the tendency of cationic cyanine dyes to form aggregates in aqueous media. In this work we investigate the interactions between two cyanine dyes, pseudoisocyanine (PIC) and pinacyanol (PIN), with polystyrenesulfonate (PSS) as the key additive to develop J- and H-aggregates. We also take advantage of the binding properties of the cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) host to control formation of these aggregates through its host-guest interactions with the dye molecules. UV/Vis absorption spectroscopic studies clearly demonstrate the PSS-enhanced formation of J-aggregates in the case of PIC and H-aggregates in the case of PIN. Electrostatic interactions between the cyanine dye molecules and the polyelectrolyte chains assist the formation of J- or H-aggregates at very low dye concentrations (ca. 10 microM). Optimum development of dye aggregates was observed at a sulfonate/dye molar ratio of about 3:1. Departures from this stoichiometric ratio seem to perturb the optimal aggregate structure. Furthermore, the presence of CB7 was found to effectively disrupt the interactions responsible for dye aggregation. Thus, CB7 completely disrupts the J-aggregates formed by PIC and the H-aggregates (as well as lower concentrations of J-aggregates) formed by PIN. UV/Vis and emission spectroscopic studies clearly indicate that binding of CB7 to both dye molecules removes them from the aggregate structures. Our spectroscopic data clearly indicate that regulation of the relative molar ratios of dye, CB7 host, and polyelectrolyte sulfonate groups leads to a quantitative control of dye aggregation, yielding variable amounts of PIC J- and PIN H-aggregates in these solutions.",,,,,
19379982,Right ventricular hypertrophy with early dysfunction: A proteomics study in a neonatal model.,"Right ventricular hypertrophy and subsequent dysfunction is common in patients with congenital heart defects, but the molecular mechanisms underlying change from adaptive hypertrophy to dysfunction remain elusive. We used the novel technique of proteomics to characterize protein changes in right ventricular myocardium in a neonatal model of right ventricular hypertrophy and early dysfunction. Twelve neonatal piglets were equally randomized to pulmonary artery banding (PAB group), or sham operation (thoracotomy without banding). After 4 weeks, right ventricular morphology and function were assessed in vivo using magnetic resonance imaging. Animals were humanely killed. Proteomics of right ventricular myocardium was performed. Purified right ventricular proteins were separated by 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis using fluorescent cyanine dyes. After gel imaging, software analysis revealed protein spots differentially expressed between the 2 groups; these spots were excised and identified by mass spectrometry. On magnetic resonance imaging, animals with pulmonary artery banding demonstrated significant right ventricular hypertrophy, cavity dilatation, and mild systolic impairment (right ventricular ejection fraction 39.8% +/- 15% vs 56.7% +/- 10% controls; P < .05). Right ventricular free wall mass on harvest confirmed right ventricular hypertrophy. Proteomic analysis revealed 18 proteins that were significantly differentially expressed: 5 structural proteins, 6 metabolic enzymes, 2 stress proteins, and 5 miscellaneous proteins. Expression of calsarcin-1 and vinculin was increased, as were certain metabolic enzymes, although F(1)-ATPase beta-chain and heat shock protein 70 decreased. This is the first study characterizing right ventricular protein changes in a large animal model specifically capturing the change from compensated to maladaptive hypertrophy. These findings can guide future work at elucidating the mechanisms in the pathophysiology of neonatal right ventricular hypertrophy and dysfunction.",,,"Animals, Animals, Newborn, Disease Models, Animal, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Gene Expression Regulation, Heart Function Tests, Heat-Shock Proteins, Hypertrophy, Right Ventricular, Ligation, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Probability, Proteins, Proteomics, Pulmonary Artery, Random Allocation, Reference Values, Sensitivity and Specificity, Stroke Volume, Swine, Time Factors, Tissue and Organ Harvesting, Ventricular Dysfunction, Right",,
19371042,Tuning of the spectroscopic properties of composite nanoparticles by the insertion of a spacer layer: effect of exciton-plasmon coupling.,"Composite nanoparticles (NPs) having a double-shell structure, Au core, spacer layer (inner shell), and J-aggregate (JA) layer (outer shell) (Au/spacer/JA) have been synthesized. The spacer layer composed of N,N,N-trimethyl(11-mercaptoundecyl)ammonium chloride played an important role in promoting the J-aggregation of anionic cyanine dyes on the surface, as evidenced by the successful formation of the JA layers with four kinds of anionic cyanine dyes. It was found that the presence of a spacer layer causes a significant change in the line shape of the absorption spectrum, particularly near the J-band; there is the appearance of a peak type absorption for the composite NPs with the double-shell structure, while there is a dip type absorption for the ones without the spacer layer. The change from the peak type absorption to the dip type absorption in the Au/spacer/JA NPs occurs when the size of the Au core is varied from 5 to 15 nm. These observations would indicate that the strength of exciton-plasmon coupling between the Au core and the JA layer is enhanced with the increase in the core size or the decrease in the separation between the Au core and the JA shell. The photoluminescence arising from the JA can be detected for the composite NPs with the double-shell structure, showing that the quenching by the Au core is effectively suppressed by the spacer layer.",,,,,
19354289,A new class of cyanine-like dyes with large bond-length alternation.,"Cyanines, which represent a class of charged chromophores with an odd number of pi-conjugated carbons, display unique electronic and optical properties attributed to the strong electronic delocalization and the absence of any significant carbon-carbon bond-length alternation (BLA) along their backbones. The flatness of the corresponding electronic potential makes cyanine dyes the compounds to which simple free-electron theory can be applied in the most relevant way. Recently, cations of porphyrin dimers linked by a pi-conjugated bridge with an odd number of carbons and presenting alternating single and triple bonds were shown to possess linear and nonlinear optical properties analogous to those of cyanines. Here, by using a joint theoretical and experimental approach, we demonstrate the correspondence between cyanines and the new class of alkyne carbocations, in spite of their marked difference in BLA.",,,,,

Their optical properties are marked by strong and narrow-band NIR absorptions. Complexation products with BF(2) and BPh(2) show strong NIR fluorescence and hardly any absorption in the visible range. We synthesized a series of new PPCys that differ only in the heterocyclic peripheral groups of the chromophore.

19282273,Differential activity-based gel electrophoresis for comparative analysis of lipolytic and esterolytic activities.,"We established a novel technique for differential activity-based gel electrophoresis (DABGE) of lipolytic enzymes from two different biological samples. For this purpose, a set of three fluorescent suicide inhibitors was developed. These probes possess the same substrate analogous structures but carry different cyanine dyes (Cy2b, Cy3, and Cy5) as reporter fluorophores. For comparison of enzyme profiles, two samples are individually labeled with a different probe followed by mixing, gel electrophoresis, fluorescence imaging, and identification of the tagged proteins by MS/MS. Protocols for quantitative determination of active enzymes were developed on the basis of lipolytic proteomes that had been admixed with defined amounts of known lipases and esterases. A detailed analysis of the fluorescence intensities showed that the found enzyme ratios very closely reflected the relative amounts of the labeled enzymes that were used for spiking. The DABGE method was used to compare the lipolytic proteomes of brown and white adipose tissue showing specific enzyme patterns of both samples. This study represents the first application of this technology for comparative analysis of lipases and esterases. Further applications of this technique can be expected to provide entirely new information on lipid enzymology in health and disease with high precision.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Chromatography, Liquid, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Enzyme Inhibitors, Esterases, Fluorescent Dyes, Lipase, Lipolysis, Mice, Molecular Sequence Data, Molecular Structure, Proteome, Tandem Mass Spectrometry",,

We studied the interaction of cyanine dyes with fibrillar proteins using fluorescence spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy. The commercially available classic amyloid stain thioflavin T (Thio T) was used as the reference dye. T-284 and SH-516 dyes can be used for fluorometric quantification of fibrillar wild-type ASN at concentrations of approximately 1.5-20 microg/ml. Both dyes appeared suitable for step-wise monitoring of ASN variants (wild-type and mutants A30P and A53T) aggregation into fibrils in vitro, demonstrating good reproducibility, exceeding that for the commonly used Thio T. Our assay may be used for screening in vitro of agents capable of affecting the aggregation of ASN. In addition, T-284 and SH-516 cyanine dyes were shown to recognize amyloid proteins of various amino acid compositions selectively. T-284 demonstrated particular sensitivity to wild-type and A53T ASN, while for SH 516, the fluorescence response to fibrillar proteins was nearly the same except for lysozymes. T-284 and SH-516 cyanine dyes are sensitive and specific fluorescent probes for monitoring ASN fibril formation process in vitro, quantification of fibrillar ASN in solution, and fluorescent detection of various fibrillar protein species.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, alpha-Synuclein",,

Simple, rapid, and specific DNA detection technologies would provide important alternatives to existing detection methods. Here we report a novel, rapid nucleic acid detection method based on the accelerated photobleaching of the light-sensitive cyanine dye, 3,3'-diethylthiacarbocyanine iodide (DiSC(2)(3) I(-)), in the presence of a target genomic DNA and a complementary peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe. On the basis of the UV-vis, circular dichroism, and fluorescence spectra of DiSC(2)(3) with PNA-DNA oligomer duplexes and on characterization of a product of photolysis of DiSC(2)(3) I(-), a possible reaction mechanism is proposed. We propose that (1) a novel complex forms between dye, PNA, and DNA, (2) this complex functions as a photosensitizer producing (1)O(2), and (3) the (1)O(2) produced promotes photobleaching of dye molecules in the mixture. Similar cyanine dyes (DiSC(3)(3), DiSC(4)(3), DiSC(5)(3), and DiSC(py)(3)) interact with preformed PNA-DNA oligomer duplexes but do not demonstrate an equivalent accelerated photobleaching effect in the presence of PNA and target genomic DNA.

19229900,Relationship between the molecular structure of cyanine dyes and the vibrational fine structure of their electronic absorption spectra.,"Electronic absorption spectra of symmetrical cyanine dyes show vibronic sub-bands, attributed to the symmetric C-C valence vibration of the polymethine chain in the electronic excited state. Displacements in the equilibrium configuration between electronic ground and excited states of cyanine dyes lead to longer C-C bonds in the excited state. Additionally, in the electronic ground state, a small degree of bond localisation always remains in the chain depending on the different heterocyclic terminal groups. Our investigations suggest that we can use (3)J(H,H) coupling constants in the polymethine chain to characterise the bond localisation within the chain. Based on these values and the Franck-Condon principle, the intensity distribution among the vibrational sub-bands can be explained.",,,,,
19227081,Microwave synthesis of near infrared heptamethine cyanine dye.,"Cyanine dyes are an interesting class of near infrared (NIR) dyes that have captured the interest of the scientific community. The NIR cyanine dye of interest, heptamethine cyanine dye NIR-1, exhibits characteristics that satisfy the qualifications as an acceptor in a Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) biosensor [Wher, 1976]. Applications of FRET systems include structure determination and conformation of proteins [Hammer et al., 2002], receptor/ligand interactions [Hammer et al., 2002], and the cellular exposure to environmental toxins [Schwartz and Ulfelder, 1992]. This research stems from an interdepartmental collaboration to develop a NIR FRET biosensor, with significant advantages over the existing systems. A critical component of this endeavor is the development of an efficient environmentally conscious synthesis of novel NIR cyanine dyes utilizing microwave technology. Herein, we report the microwave synthesis of NIR-1. 2,3,3-Trimethyl-1-ethyl-3H-indolium iodide (I) synthesis is advantageous over the reported synthesis due to the significantly reduced reaction time of 450 s from 15 h and a decrease in the amount of iodoethane from 5 eq. to 3 eq. The condensation of heterocyclic salt I and bisaldehyde II has been accomplished in 220 s in 85% yield in the microwave oven; benzene has been eliminated from the condensation reaction procedure. Spectral characteristics of NIR-1 were determined and compared to commercially available NIR-1. A significant absence of asymmetry at the broad peak associated with the maximum absorbance wavelength, a slight increase in quantum yield (+ approximately .02) and the blue shift of the maximum absorbance wavelength (- approximately 5 nm) was observed.",,,,,
19226170,Influence of streptavidin on the absorption and fluorescence properties of cyanine dyes.,"Cyanine dyes have become widely used fluorescence labels in clinical and biological chemistry. In particular, cyanine dyes with excitation wavelengths lambda(ex) > 600 nm are often used in biological applications. However, aggregation behavior and matrix effects on cyanine fluorescence are not fully understood yet and interfere with the data interpretation. In this study, we analyzed the spectroscopic characteristics of a model system consisting of the biotinylated cyanine dyes DY-635 and DY-647 and their streptavidin conjugates. On the basis of the spectroscopic data, the interaction processes between cyanine dye molecules and proteins are discussed. Binding to streptavidin had a significant influence on both fluorescence and anisotropy decays of the cyanine dyes investigated. In particular, the fluorescence anisotropy was significantly altered, making it a promising detection parameter for bioanalytical applications in connection with the cyanine dyes used in the present study. In order to evaluate the time-resolved anisotropy, the introduction of a sophisticated kinetic model was required to describe the contributions from different fluorescing species properly. The rotational motion of streptavidin-bound dyes was analyzed using the associated anisotropy model, which allowed discrimination between contributions from different microenvironments. The anisotropy decay times increased by a factor of up to 20 due to protein binding.",,,"Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Protein Binding, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Streptavidin, Streptomyces",,

19197932,On the signalling pathways and Cu(II)-mediated anion indication of N-meso-substituted heptamethine cyanine dyes.,"Join or attack: meso-Cyclam-substituted heptamethine cyanine dye 1 responds very differently to the presence of metal ions and protons. Whereas the former are embraced in a host-guest complex, the latter attack the cyanine pi system (see picture). In the presence of Cu(II), 1 selectively forms near-infrared absorbing aggregates in buffered solution that allow the determination of citrate by using colourimetry.Three mid-chain rigidified heptamethine cyanine dyes substituted with dimethylamino or cyclam groups at the meso position of the polymethine chain have been prepared and studied both experimentally and theoretically with respect to their spectroscopic response toward protons and various metal ions. Despite a potentially rich conformational ground-state chemistry, the spectroscopic studies revealed that the behaviour of the dyes is in agreement with Kuhn's classic polymethine dye theory. Coordination of metal ions and protonation of the alkyl amino groups in the cyclam moiety accordingly lead to moderate bathochromic shifts in absorption and reduced Stokes shifts. In contrast, protonation of the dimethylamino-substituted derivatives occurs at the polymethine chain, transforming the heptamethine into a trimethine-type chromophore with concomitant gigantic spectral blueshifts. In the presence of Cu(II) in buffered aqueous solution, the cyclam-substituted dye selectively forms near-infrared absorbing aggregates. The latter allow the determination of citrate under realistic conditions by changes in absorption at wavelengths greater than 800 nm, which results from a disruption of the aggregates when citrate binds to Cu(II). The copper ions thus act as mediators in a signalling reaction that constitutes a colourimetric displacement assay.",,,,,

19155190,Computational study of steric and spectroscopic characteristics of bi-chromophoric cyanine dyes: comparison with experimental data.,"The spectral and energetic characteristics of four bi-chromophoric cyanine dyes (BCDs) which possess angles between chromophores 180 degrees , 150 degrees , 120 degrees and 90 degrees , were studied using quantum chemical calculations in comparison with experimental data. It was demonstrated that for BCD with 180 degrees , 150 degrees and 90 degrees trans-trans isomers possess the lowest energy, while for BCD with 120 degrees the trans-trans and cis-trans isomers have comparable energies and in the temperature range from 273K up to 373K both isomers of this dye are present. It was also demonstrated that the splitting of the spectra of cyanine dyes with two chromophores (BCD) was determined by two effects: the dipole-dipole chromophore interaction and the electron tunneling through the central heterocycle. Both effects depend on the central heterocycle structure, which on the one hand determines the distance between the chromophores, thus determining the value of the dipole-dipole interaction, and on the other hand the degree of pi-conjugation in the central heterocycle determines the probability of electron tunneling. The central heterocycle structure determines relative orientation of the chromophore dipoles, as well, thus determining the intensities of the short-wavelength and long-wavelength bands in the BCD absorption spectra.",,,"Carbocyanines, Isomerism, Molecular Conformation, Molecular Structure, Quantum Theory, Spectrum Analysis",,
19014508,Development of a novel ozone- and photo-stable HyPer5 red fluorescent dye for array CGH and microarray gene expression analysis with consistent performance irrespective of environmental conditions.,"Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and gene expression profiling have become vital techniques for identifying molecular defects underlying genetic diseases. Regardless of the microarray platform, cyanine dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) are one of the most widely used fluorescent dye pairs for microarray analysis owing to their brightness and ease of incorporation, enabling high level of assay sensitivity. However, combining both dyes on arrays can become problematic during summer months when ozone levels rise to near 25 parts per billion (ppb). Under such conditions, Cy5 is known to rapidly degrade leading to loss of signal from either ""homebrew"" or commercial arrays. Cy5 can also suffer disproportionately from dye photobleaching resulting in distortion of (Cy5/Cy3) ratios used in copy number analysis. Our laboratory has been active in fluorescent dye research to find a suitable alternative to Cy5 that is stable to ozone and resistant to photo-bleaching. Here, we report on the development of such a dye, called HyPer5, and describe its' exceptional ozone and photostable properties on microarrays. Our results show HyPer5 signal to be stable to high ozone levels. Repeated exposure of mouse arrays hybridized with HyPer5-labeled cDNA to 300 ppb ozone at 5, 10 and 15 minute intervals resulted in no signal loss from the dye. In comparison, Cy5 arrays showed a dramatic 80% decrease in total signal during the same interval. Photobleaching experiments show HyPer5 to be resistant to light induced damage with 3- fold improvement in dye stability over Cy5. In high resolution array CGH experiments, HyPer5 is demonstrated to detect chromosomal aberrations at loci 2p21-16.3 and 15q26.3-26.2 from three patient sample using bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) arrays. The photostability of HyPer5 is further documented by repeat array scanning without loss of detection. Additionally, HyPer5 arrays are shown to preserve sensitivity and data quality from gene expression experiments. HyPer5 is a red fluorescent dye that behaves functionally similar to Cy5 except in stability to ozone and light. HyPer5 is demonstrated to be resistant to ozone at up to 300 ppb, levels significantly higher than commonly observed during summer months. Consequently, HyPer5 dye can be used in parallel with Cy3 under any environmental conditions in array experiments.",,,"Carbocyanines, Comparative Genomic Hybridization, DNA, Complementary, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Expression Profiling, Light, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Ozone, Photobleaching, Sensitivity and Specificity",,
19007116,Control of H- and J-aggregate formation via host-guest complexation using cucurbituril hosts.,"The binding interactions between two cyanine dyes, pseudoisocyanine (PIC) and pinacyanol (PIN), and the cucurbit[n]uril hosts, cucurbit[7]uril (CB7) and cucurbit[6]uril (CB6), were investigated by electronic absorption spectroscopy and DFT computational methods. The CB7 host forms more stable complexes with both dyes than CB6 and the computational studies suggest that the cavity of the smaller host CB6 is not threaded by the dyes. The equilibrium association constants (K) for complexation by CB7 were measured and found to be 2.05 x 10(4) and 3.84 x 10(5) M(-1) for PIC and PIN, respectively, in aqueous media at 23 degrees C. CB7 complexation was found to effectively disrupt the intermolecular forces responsible for the aggregation of both dyes. Thus, CB7 completely disrupts the J-aggregates formed by PIC and the H-aggregates (as well as lower concentrations of J-aggregates) formed by PIN. In both cases a competing guest, 1-aminoadamantane (AD), could be used to adjust the extent of aggregation of the cyanine dye.

Fluorescence imaging methods are generally superior in terms of sensitivity, selectivity and ease of use. Cyanine dyes have been employed as fluorescent labels in fluorescence imaging studies of biological mechanisms. In particular, tricarbocyanines have the advantage that light at their emission and absorption maxima in the near-infrared (NIR) region around 650-900 nm is relatively poorly absorbed by biomolecules, and so can penetrate deeply into tissues. There is also less autofluorescence in this region. In addition to cyanine dyes for straightforward fluorescence labeling, we successfully developed cyanine dyes whose fluorescence intensity changes upon specific reaction with nitric oxide, which is an important signaling molecule involved in the regulation of a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms, and many disorders. Then, we synthesized dipicolylcyanine (DIPCY), consisting of tricarbocyanine as a fluorophore and dipicolylethylenediamine as a heavy metal chelator, and investigated its response to various heavy metal ions. Upon addition of zinc ion, a red shift of the absorbance maximum was observed. Namely, DIPCY can work as a ratiometric fluorescent sensor for zinc ion in the NIR region. Moreover, we have recently developed several pH probes based on the amine-substituted tricarbocyanine fluorophore. We could measure pH with these fluorescent probes by a ratiometric monitoring method.",,,"Alkanesulfonates, Carbocyanines, Diagnostic Imaging, Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Nitric Oxide, Spectroscopy, Near-Infrared",,
18970263,A study of intramolecular H-complexes of novel bis(heptamethine cyanine) dyes.,"Near-infrared (NIR) bis(heptamethine cyanine) (BHmC) dyes containing a flexible polymethylene linker between the two cyanine subunits are a novel class of compounds with versatile spectroscopic properties. The first bis-cyanine of this type is BHmC-10 (with a decamethylene bridge) that has been reported by us recently [G. Patonay, J.S. Kim, R. Kodagahally, L. Strekowski, Appl. Spectrosc., in press]. As part of this work, additional bis-cyanines BHmC-4, BHmC-6, and BHmC-8 were synthesized and their spectral properties were evaluated for the dyes free in solution and in the presence of human serum albumin (HSA). These bis-cyanines undergo H-type aggregation, mainly H-type intramolecular complexation between the two cyanine subunits, when free in aqueous solution. This H-type interaction in phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) is characterized by hypsochromic (H) absorption at 700nm, low extinction coefficient, and low fluorescence quantum yield. By contrast, an analogous monomeric cyanine exhibits strong fluorescence under similar conditions. Upon binding with HSA, the fluorescence of BHmC-6 changes negligibly, that for BHmC-8 shows a slight increase, and the fluorescence of BHmC-4 is greatly increased. It is suggested that BHmC-4 binds with HSA in the open form exclusively, while the H-type intramolecular interaction in BHmC-6 is mostly retained in the complex with HSA. Bis-cyanine BHmC-4 may be of significant bioanalytical utility due to its negligible fluorescence in aqueous solution and a strong increase in fluorescence upon binding with a protein.",,,,,

In the acidic medium in the presence of chloride ions, extractable by aromatic hydrocarbons and esters of acetic acids, chromium(VI) ion associates are formed. The molar absorptivities of ion associates are 2.5-3.6x10(5) l mol(-1) cm(-1) in dependence on extractant and dye. The absorbance of the coloured extracts obeys the Beer's law in the range 0.01-2.1 mg l(-1). The extraction of chromium is the highest during extraction from the sulphuric acid medium in the range 0.05-03 M H(2)SO(4). It was found that the Cr(VI):Cl:R molar ratio is 1:1:1. A novel procedure of chromium(VI) extraction and spectrophotometric determination in various types of soils and sewage doped with chromium(VI) was examined.",,,,,
18802811,Symmetric cyanine dyes for detecting nucleic acids.,A novel approach to the design of sensitive fluorescent probes for nucleic acids detection is proposed. Suitable modifications of tri- and pentamethine cyanine dyes in the polymethine chain and/or in the heterocyclic residues can result in a significant decrease in unbound dye fluorescence intensity and an increase in dye emission intensity in the presence of DNA compared to the unsubstituted dye. The sharp enhancement in the fluorescence intensity upon dye interaction with double-stranded DNA permits the application of the modified tri- and pentamethine dyes as fluorescent probes in double-stranded DNA detection in homogeneous assays.,,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Humans, Nucleic Acids, Staining and Labeling",,

The results show that the peaks of fluorescence spectral curves of anionic-cationic cyanine dyes were lower than that of anionic and cationic cyanine dyes, and the higher sensitivity efficiency was due to the fact that more electrons transfer to the surface of AgIBr microcrystal.",,,,,

Several FAPs were selected that bind to the dye with low nanomolar Kd values and enhance fluorescence more than 100-fold.

18606615,Tetraalkylammonium derivatives as real-time PCR enhancers and stabilizers of the qPCR mixtures containing SYBR Green I.,"Tetraalkylammonium (TAA) derivatives have been reported to serve as stabilizers of asymmetrical cyanine dyes in aqueous solutions and to increase the yield and efficiency of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected by end-point analysis. In this study, we compared the ability of various TAA derivatives (with alkyl chain ranging from 1 to 5 carbons) and some other compounds to serve as enhancers of real-time PCR based on fluorescence detection from intercalating dye SYBR Green I (SGI). Our data indicate that TAA chlorides and some other TAA derivatives serve as potent enhancers of SGI-monitored real-time PCR. Optimal results were obtained with 10-16 mM tetrapropylammonium chloride. The effect of TAA compounds was dependent on the nature of counter ions present and composition of the reaction mixtures used. Based on measurements of SGI-generated fluorescence signal in the presence of PCR-amplified DNA fragments, oligonucleotide primers and/or various additives, we propose that TAA-derivatives reduce the binding of SGI to oligonucleotide primers and thus enhance primer-template interactions during annealing phase. Furthermore, these compounds serve as stabilizers of SGI-containing PCR mixtures. The combined data indicate that TAA derivatives might be a new class of additives contributing to robustness of real-time PCR monitored by asymmetrical cyanine dye SGI.",,,"Animals, Benzothiazoles, Diamines, Fluorescent Dyes, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Organic Chemicals, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Quaternary Ammonium Compounds, Quinolines, Temperature",,

This method attempts to replace the nitroso group with a biotin label to allow detection and isolation of S-nitrosated proteins and has been used extensively in the literature. This chapter describes a modification of this method that differs from the original in two major ways. First, it uses a combination of copper ions and ascorbate to achieve selective reduction of the S-nitrosothiol. Second, it replaces the biotin label with fluorescent cyanine dyes in order to directly observe the modified proteins in-gel and perform comparative studies using difference gel electrophoresis analysis in two dimensions.",,,"Animals, Gels, Humans, Nitrosation, Proteins, S-Nitrosothiols, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
18547069,Nanoscale structuring of semiconducting molecular blend films in the presence of mobile counterions.,"The controlled fabrication of submicrometer phase-separated morphologies of semiconducting organic materials is attracting considerable interest, for example, in emerging thin-film optoelectronic device applications. For thin films of spin-coated blends of PCBM ([6,6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric acid methyl ester) and cationic cyanine dyes, we used atomic force microscopy scans to infer the structure formation mechanism: The solutions separate into transient bilayers, which further spinodally destabilize because of long-range molecular interactions. A thin layer ruptures earlier than a thick layer, and the earlier instability determines the morphology. Consequently, the resulting morphology type mainly depends on the ratio of the layer thicknesses, whereas the periodicity of structures is determined by the absolute film thickness. These findings allow control of the feature sizes, and nodular domains with diameters well below 50 nm were produced. Films prepared with dyes possessing a mobile counterion were always unstable. To rationalize the findings, we developed a thermodynamic model showing that electrostatic forces induced by the mobile counterions act as destabilizing pressure.",,,,,

Although the dyes have intrinsic tendencies to form J- or H-aggregates in aqueous solutions, their aggregation could be regulated in the complex films. Depending on the spacer, both J- and H-aggregates were formed for SeCy, whereas an H-aggregate with different absorption bands was obtained for MTC. Furthermore, the formed aggregates in the films could be reversibly switched by treating the complex films with HCl, NH3 gas, or water vapor. The J-aggregates of SeCy could be changed into H-aggregates and recovered through an alternative HCl/NH3 exposure in the films. The H-aggregate of the MTC film could be changed into J-aggregate upon exposure to HCl gas and subsequently put into air or NH 3 gas, and the thus-formed J-aggregate could be changed into H-aggregate under hot water vapor. In addition, such a reversible switch between different aggregates of MTC was only observed when the gemini amphiphiles with rigid spacers were applied. A possible explanation related to the protonation of the dye and the reorganizations in the film during the interconversion between different aggregates was proposed.",,,"Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, Gases, Microscopy, Atomic Force, Molecular Structure, Pressure, Spectrophotometry, Surface Properties",,

Here, we investigated whether the degree of tumour angiogenesis can be assessed in vivo by planar and tomographic methods using the perfusion-type cyanine dye SIDAG (1,1'-bis- [4-sulfobutyl]indotricarbocyanine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid diglucamide monosodium). Mice were xenografted with moderately (MCF7, DU4475) or highly vascularized (HT1080, MDA-MB435) tumours and scanned up to 24 hours after intravenous SIDAG injection using fluorescence reflectance imaging. Contrast-to-noise ratio was calculated for all tumours, and fluorochrome accumulation was quantified using fluorescence-mediated tomography. The vascular volume fraction of the xenografts, serving as a surrogate marker for angiogenesis, was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, and blood vessel profile (BVP) density and vascular endothelial growth factor expression were determined. SIDAG accumulation correlated well with angiogenic burden, with maximum contrast to noise ratio for MDA-MB435 (P < 0.0001), followed by HT1080, MCF7 and DU4475 tumours. Fluorescence-mediated tomography revealed 4.6-fold higher fluorochrome concentrations in MDA-MB435 than in DU4475 tumours (229 +/- 90 nmol/l versus 49 +/- 22 nmol/l; P < 0.05). The vascular volume fraction was 4.5-fold (3.58 +/- 0.9% versus 0.8 +/- 0.53%; P < 0.01), blood vessel profile density 5-fold (399 +/- 36 BVPs/mm2 versus 78 +/- 16 BVPs/mm2) and vascular endothelial growth factor expression 4-fold higher for MDA-MB435 than for DU4475 tumours.

18329038,Towards a FRET-based immunosensor for continuous carbohydrate monitoring.,"In this report we have evaluated the potential of using fluorescence/Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) in a competitive immunosensor for continuous monitoring of the carbohydrate hapten maltose. The cyanine dyes Cy5 and Cy5.5 were used as a donor-acceptor pair by conjugation to maltose-labeled bovine serum albumin (BSA) and the monoclonal antibody IgG 39.5, giving Cy5-BSA-maltotriitol (3.1/1/18) and Cy5.5-mAb39.5 (2.2/1), respectively. This antibody with weak affinity towards maltose showed full reversibility to both the free maltose and the maltose-labeled conjugate. It allowed us to measure continuously the maltose content by monitoring the FRET signal change over time due to displacement of Cy5-BSA-maltotriitol from Cy5.5-mAb39.5 inside a semipermeable capsule. A near 22% total increase was seen in the fluorescence intensity ratio I(670)/I(700) in the presence of maltose, with a calculated EC(50)=1.87+/-0.13 mM (R(2)=0.9984) from the sigmoidal dose-response curve at 25 degrees C. Specificity of the immunosensor was shown with the structural analog to maltose, cellobiose, and it generated no detectable response. A minor drift in the sensor baseline was seen with 0.4% per 24 h, which was in the same magnitude as the signal-to-noise ratio, during the 4 weeks of measurements. The immunosensor was applied to crude samples of oat drinks for direct quantification of the maltose content. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential to use an immunosensor based on weakly binding antibodies and FRET technology for remote and non-invasive carbohydrate monitoring.",,,"Biosensing Techniques, Carbocyanines, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Food Technology, Maltose",,

18191871,Silica nanoparticles encapsulating near-infrared emissive cyanine dyes.,"We show that efficient near-infrared (NIR) cyanine fluorophores (1 and 2) can be encapsulated into silica nanoparticles providing a highly versatile and unique platform for in vivo diagnostics. Utilizing this platform, multiple fluorophores can be loaded within a single particle allowing the light absorption and emission properties of the nanoparticle to be controlled independent of particle size. Furthermore, such dyed nanoparticles may have extinction coefficients as high as about 100 x 10(6) Lmol(-1)cm(-1) in the NIR (on a per mole of particles basis), with quantum yields from about 8-10%. A simple synthetic method for varying particle size and dye-loading level is presented, and a modified Stober synthesis reduces deleterious exposure of the dye to the highly alkaline conditions used. The cyanine dyes are encapsulated in silica in a non-aggregated state and the fluorescence brightness is largely maintained to nominal dye concentrations approaching 50 muM. The ability to control light absorption and emission properties independent of particle size, and convenient access to particle sizes in the range of 20-100 nm (a size regime difficult to access with other nanoparticle approaches such as quantum dots), are important features for anatomical targeting in in vivo diagnostics and targeted therapeutic applications.",,,"Absorption, Carbocyanines, Microscopy, Electron, Transmission, Nanoparticles, Silicon Dioxide, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectrophotometry, Infrared",,

Upon adsorption onto a TiO(2) electrode, the absorption spectra of the three cyanine dyes are all broadened to both red and blue sides compared with their respective spectra in an acetonitrile and ethanol mixture. Cy2 and Cy3, containing a naphthalimide group, have stronger absorption intensities and broader absorption spectra than , which consequently leads to better light-to-electricity conversion properties. Among the three cyanine dyes, generated the highest photoelectric conversion yield of 4.80% (J(sc) = 14.5 mA cm(-2), V(oc) = 500 mV, FF = 0.49) under illumination with 75 mW cm(-2) white light from a Xe lamp.",,,,,

The successive dilutions form a dose-response curve from which performance can be assessed. The effects of a variety of factors, including the number of scans and slide storage conditions, on scanner performance over a five-week period were investigated and tracked with time series charts of dye signal intensity, signal-to-noise (S/N), signal background, slope, and limit of detection (LOD). Scanner drift was tracked with a known stable reference material, Standard Reference Material (SRM) 2242. The greatest effect on the figures of merit was the dye, with the Cy5 dye showing signs of degradation after one week of scanning independent of all other factors while the Cy3 dye remained relatively stable. Use of the charts to track scanner performance over time holds promise for development of a method for microarray scanner performance qualification. Although not a prescription for performance qualification, this introductory study provides sufficient information regarding the use of dye slides to enable the user to institute a preliminary test method.",,,,,

17981472,New cyanine dyes as base surrogates in PNA: forced intercalation probes (FIT-probes) for homogeneous SNP detection.,"Forced intercalation probes (FIT-probes) are nucleic acid probes, in which an intercalator cyanine dye such as thiazole orange (TO) serves as a replacement of a canonical nucleobase. These probes signal hybridization by showing strong increases of fluorescence. TO in FIT-probes responds to adjacent base mismatches by attenuation of fluorescence intensities at conditions where both matched and mismatched target DNA are bound. The interesting features of TO labeled FIT-probes posed the question whether the forced intercalation concept can be extended to other cyanine dyes of the thiazole orange family. Herein, we present the synthesis of three asymmetrical cyanine dyes and their incorporation into PNA-conjugates by means of both divergent and linear solid-phase synthesis. Melting analysis revealed that the DNA affinity of PNA probes remained high irrespective of the replacement of a nucleobase by the cyanines YO (oxazole yellow), MO or JO. Of the three new tested dye-PNA-conjugates, the YO-containing PNA has properties useful for homogeneous SNP detection. YO-PNA is demonstrated to signal the presence of fully complementary DNA by up to 20-fold enhancement of fluorescence. In addition, YO emission discriminates against single base mismatches by attenuation of fluorescence.

17980608,Specific fluorescent detection of fibrillar alpha-synuclein using mono- and trimethine cyanine dyes.,"With the aim of searching of novel amyloid-specific fluorescent probes the ability of series of mono- and trimethine cyanines based on benzothiazole, pyridine and quinoline heterocycle end groups to recognize fibrillar formations of alpha-synuclein (ASN) was studied. For the first time it was revealed that monomethine cyanines can specifically increase their fluorescence in aggregated ASN presence. Dialkylamino-substituted monomethine cyanine T-284 and meso-ethyl-substituted trimethine cyanine SH-516 demonstrated the higher emission intensity and selectivity to aggregated ASN than classic amyloid stain Thioflavin T, and could be proposed as novel efficient fluorescent probes for fibrillar ASN detection. Studies of structure-function dependences have shown that incorporation of amino- or diethylamino- substituents into the 6-position of the benzothiazole heterocycle yields in a appearance of a selective fluorescent response to fibrillar alpha-synuclein presence. Performed calculations of molecular dimensions of studied cyanine dyes gave us the possibility to presume, that dyes bind with their long axes parallel to the fibril axis via insertion into the neat rows (so called 'channels') running along fibril.",,,"Buffers, Carbocyanines, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Models, Molecular, Molecular Structure, Protein Binding, alpha-Synuclein",,
17964850,Determination of the dimerization constant of pinacyanol: role of the thermochromic effect.,"Pinacyanol (PIN), as other cyanine dyes, has demonstrated a unique ability to form associates such as dimers, and H- and J-aggregates. This association is strongly favoured in water, and even at low dye concentrations, dimers and superior order aggregates are present. As a consequence, the determination of the dimerization constant involves sometimes a significant error when these aggregates are neglected. As an increase in temperature shifts the equilibrium among the different species towards the lowest order aggregates, we have obtained the spectra of PIN at several temperatures. By extrapolating some spectral characteristics at high temperatures, a spectrum of the dimer without any contribution of other aggregates was obtained. From this spectrum and that of the monomer, the dimerization constant was calculated, as well as the Gibbs energy change associated to the reaction. The enthalpy and entropy changes of the dimerization were determined from the dependence of the dimerization constants on the temperature. From these results it can be inferred that the driving force of the dimerization is of enthalpic origin.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Dimerization, Solutions, Spectrophotometry, Thermodynamics",,
17949141,Double-hybrid density functional theory for excited electronic states of molecules.,"Double-hybrid density functionals are based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange and correlation with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional (dubbed B2PLYP) contains only two empirical parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (ax) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (ac), respectively. Extensive testing has recently demonstrated the outstanding accuracy of this approach for various ground state problems in general chemistry applications. The method is extended here without any further empirical adjustments to electronically excited states in the framework of time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) or the closely related Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA-DFT). In complete analogy to the ground state treatment, a scaled second-order perturbation correction to configuration interaction with singles (CIS(D)) wave functions developed some years ago by Head-Gordon et al. [Chem. Phys. Lett. 219, 21 (1994)] is computed on the basis of density functional data and added to the TD(A)-DFTGGA excitation energy. The method is implemented by applying the resolution of the identity approximation and the efficiency of the code is discussed. Extensive tests for a wide variety of molecules and excited states (of singlet, triplet, and doublet multiplicities) including electronic spectra are presented. In general, rather accurate excitation energies (deviations from reference data typically <0.2 eV) are obtained that are mostly better than those from standard functionals. Still, systematic errors are obtained for Rydberg (too low on average by about 0.3 eV) and charge-transfer transitions but due to the relatively large ax parameter (0.53), B2PLYP outperforms most other functionals in this respect. Compared to conventional HF-based CIS(D), the method is more robust in electronically complex situations due to the implicit account of static correlation effects by the GGA parts. The (D) correction often works in the right direction and compensates for the overestimation of the transition energy at the TD level due to the elevated fraction of HF exchange in the hybrid GGA part. Finally, the limitations of the method are discussed for challenging systems such as transition metal complexes, cyanine dyes, and multireference cases.",,,,,
17674164,"Novel, monomeric cyanine dyes as reporters for DNA helicase activity.","The dimeric cyanine dyes, YOYO-1 and TOTO-1, are widely used as DNA probes because of their excellent fluorescent properties. They have a higher fluorescence quantum yield than ethidium homodimer, DAPI and Hoechst dyes and bind to double-stranded DNA with high affinity. However, these dyes are limited by heterogeneous staining at high dye loading, photocleavage of DNA under extended illumination, nicking of DNA, and inhibition of the activity of DNA binding enzymes. To overcome these limitations, seven novel cyanine dyes (Cyan-2, DC-21, DM, DM-1, DMB-2OH, SH-0367, SH1015-OH) were synthesized and tested for fluorescence emission, resistance to displacement by Mg(2+), and the ability to function as reporters for DNA unwinding. Results show that Cyan-2, DM-1, SH-0367 and SH1015-OH formed highly fluorescent complexes with dsDNA. Of these, only Cyan-2 and DM-1 exhibited a large fluorescence enhancement in buffers, and were resistant to displacement by Mg(2+). The potential of these two dyes to function as reporter molecules was evaluated using continuous fluorescence, DNA helicase assays. The rate of DNA unwinding was not significantly affected by either of these two dyes.

BOXTO-MEE is derived from BOXTO by adding the polar methoxyethoxyethyl tail in order to increase solubility, dissociation rate kinetics, and stability. As a result, BOXTO-MEE showed significant reduction in nonspecific amplification (primer dimers) without significant effect on target sequence amplification, PCR efficiency, and standard curve correlation coefficient. BETIBO is another example of an asymmetric cyanine dye that can binds to dsDNA but is less efficient than BOXTO-MEE for use in real-time PCR. Statistical analysis of reproducibility results shows that BETIBO is not strong enough to be used for quantifying low nucleic acid quantities. Statistical analysis for BOXTO-MEE results shows that there is no significant difference between the efficiency and correlation coefficient achieved by BOXTO-MEE and SYBR Green I, but a significant difference in the dynamic range is observed because BOXTO-MEE has a wider dynamic range. BOXTO-MEE stock solution was stable at -20 degrees C for more than 1 year and 40 microM solution was stable for 45 days (at least) at 4 degrees C.",,,"Benzothiazoles, Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, DNA, DNA Primers, DNA Probes, Diamines, Fluorescent Dyes, Kinetics, Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, Organic Chemicals, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Quinolines, Reproducibility of Results, Solubility, Temperature",,

17636984,Regulation of aggregation and morphology of cyanine dyes on monolayers via gemini amphiphiles.,"The aggregation of dyes is of considerable importance in relating to their functions and applications. In this paper, we have investigated the regulation on the aggregation and morphology of two cyanine dyes, 3,3'-disulfopropyl-4,5,4',5'-dibenzo-9-methylthiacarbocyanine triethylammonium salt (MTC) and 3,3'-disulfopropyl-4,5,4',5'-dibenzo-9-phenylthiacarbocyanine triethylammonium salt (PTC), using a series of gemini amphiphiles (bis(2'-heptadecyl-3'-ethylimidazolium)-1,n-alkane dibromide, abbreviated as Gn, n=2, 4, 6, 8, 10). It has been found that both of the dyes could be adsorbed onto the monolayers of the gemini amphiphiles through the electrostatic and pi-pi interaction and stacked into H- or J-aggregate. The spacer of the gemini amphiphile showed good control over the aggregation of MTC: H-aggregate was favored when gemini amphiphiles with short spacer were applied, while J-aggregation was preferred in the case of longer spacer. Only J-aggregate was observed for PTC on gemini monolayer, regardless of the structure of the gemini amphiphiles. Interesting morphologies were observed for all the gemini/dye complex monolayers. Network structure and nanofibers were formed for the gemini/MTC films transferred below the plateau surface pressure and close to the collapse pressure, respectively. The ability of the complex monolayers to form nanofibers strongly depended on the component amphiphiles, G2>G4>G6, and no nanofibers were observed for G8/MTC and G10/MTC after the collapse. Only squared domains were observed for gemini/PTC monolayers. When both G2 and G10 were mixed, an individual control of the gemini amphiphiles over the aggregation of MTC in the complex monolayers was observed. The relationship among the spacer, dye structure, and aggregation was revealed.",,,,,
17583926,"Novel water-soluble near-infrared cyanine dyes: synthesis, spectral properties, and use in the preparation of internally quenched fluorescent probes.","In this paper, we describe the synthesis and the photophysical properties of two novel near-infrared (NIR) cyanine dyes (NIR5.5-2 and NIR7.0-2) which are water soluble potential substitutes of the commercially available Cy 5.5 and Cy 7.0 fluorescent labels respectively. For each one of these cyanine dyes, the synthetic strategy relies on the postsynthetic derivatization of a cyanine precursor in order to introduce the key functionalities required for bioconjugation of these NIR fluorophores. For NIR5.5-2, a reactive amino group was acylated with an original trisulfonated linker for water solubility. For NIR7.0-2, a vinylic chlorine atom was derivatized through a SRN1 reaction for the introduction of a monoreactive carboxyl group for labeling purposes. Unexpectedly, when these two fluorophores were closely associated within a peptidic architecture, mutual fluorescence quenching between NIR5.5-2 and NIR7.0-2 was observed both at 705 (NIR5.5-2) and 798 nm (NIR7.0-2).

The dyes containing amino and acetamido groups were conveniently synthesized by the condensation of two p-toluenesulfonate heterocyclic quaternary salts and were obtained in the forms of iodide, bromide, and tosylate counteranions. These dyes were compared to ethidium bromide as stains for DNA in electrophoretic gels. The overall results obtained for the sensitivity of these dyes suggest the suitability of acetamido moiety over the amine one and bromide as the counteranion when compared with iodide and tosylate, with a similar capacity of DNA detection in relation to the ethidium bromide stain over the concentration range of 1-3ng.",,,"Acetamides, Amination, Carbocyanines, DNA, Electrophoresis, Agar Gel, Methane, Molecular Structure",,
17543269,Influence of cyanine dye structure on self-aggregation and interaction with nucleic acids: a kinetic approach to TO and BO binding.,"Kinetics and equilibria of cyanine dyes thiazole orange (TO) and benzothiazole orange (BO) self-aggregation and binding to CT-DNA are investigated in aqueous solution at 25 degrees C and pH 7. Absorbance spectra and T-jump experiments reveal that BO forms J-aggregates while TO forms more stable H-aggregates. Fluorescence and absorbance titrations show that TO binds to DNA more tightly than BO. TO stacks externally to DNA for low polymer-to-dye concentration ratios (C(P)/C(D)) while dye intercalation occurs for high values of C(P)/C(D). T-jump and stopped-flow experiments performed at high C(P)/C(D) agree with reaction scheme D+S <=> D,S <=> DS(I) <=> DS(II) where the precursor complex D,S evolves to a partially intercalated complex DS(I) which converts to the more stable intercalate DS(II). Non-electrostatic forces play a major role in D,S stabilization. Last step is similar for both dyes suggesting accommodation of the common benzothiazole residue between base pairs. Experiments using poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) confirm base pair preference for TO.",,,"Benzothiazoles, Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Computer Simulation, Crystallization, DNA, Dimerization, Fluorescent Dyes, Intercalating Agents, Kinetics, Models, Chemical, Quinolines",,

The method allows easy preparation of dyes with chloro- and iodoacetamide side chains for covalent attachment to cysteine. By placing a sulfonato group directly on the dye fluorophore system, dyes with high fluorescence quantum yields in water were generated.

17482339,Spectroscopic investigation on the interaction of J-aggregate with human serum albumin.,"The interactions of three cyanine dyes, which exhibit different meso substituent in polymethine chain, with human serum albumin (HSA) have been investigated by the means of absorption, fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectra. In phosphate buffer solution (PBS), the mentioned dyes exist not as isolated monomers but rather in the formation of J-aggregation. In the presence of HSA, the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra indicated that the J-aggregation was decomposed to monomer because of the strong affinity between dye molecules and HSA. Besides the association of cyanine dyes with HSA, binding to HSA gave rise to the J-aggregation CD signals. The meso substituent in the polymethine plays an important role in the interaction of HSA and the J-aggregation. Spectral studies showed that the dye bound with HSA in a 1:1 formation. The apparent constant (K(a)) value was roughly identified by analysis of the corresponding fluorescence data at various HSA concentrations. The higher affinity of the molecule with meso phenyl towards HSA with respect to molecules with meso ethyl or methyl can be attributed to the arrangement of molecules in J-aggregation and the hydrophobic force between the molecules and HSA.",,,"Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, Coloring Agents, Humans, Molecular Structure, Serum Albumin, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectrophotometry, Atomic",,
17467807,Cyanine dye-protein interactions: looking for fluorescent probes for amyloid structures.,"We ascertained the ability to detect fibrillar beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) of a series of mono-, tri-, penta-, and heptamethinecyanines based on benzothiazole and benzimidazole heterocycles, and of benzothiazole squaraine. Fluorescence properties of these cyanine dyes were measured in the unbound state and in the presence of monomeric and fibrillar BLG and compared with those for the commercially available benzothiazole dye Thioflavin T. The correlation between the chemical nature of the dye molecules and the ability of dyes to bind aggregated proteins was established. We found that meso-substituted cyanines with amino substituents in heterocycle in contrast to the corresponding unsubstituted dyes have a binding preference to fibrillar BLG and a noticeable fluorescence response in the presence of the aggregated protein. For the squaraines and benzimidazole penthamethinecyanines studied, fluorescence emission increased both in the presence of native and fibrillar protein. The trimethinecyanines T-49 and SH-516 exhibit specifically increased fluorescence in the presence of fibrillar BLG. These dyes demonstrated the same or higher emission intensity and selectivity to aggregated BLG as Thioflavin T, and are proposed for application in selective fluorescent detection of aggregated proteins.",,,"Amyloid, Animals, Benzothiazoles, Carbocyanines, Congo Red, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, In Vitro Techniques, Lactoglobulins, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Thiazoles",,
17436564,"Review. Photooxygenation, photodegradation and antioxidative activity of platonin, a cyanine photosensitizing dye.","Platonin (4,4'-dimethyl-3,3'-di-n-heptyl-8-[2-(4methyl-3-n-heptylthiazole)] -2,2'-dicarbocyanine diiodine) is one of the photosensitive trithiazolepentamethine cyanine dyes. Visible light (VL)-promoted photodegradation products of platonin in an aqueous environment were identified as 3-heptyl4-methylthiazoline-2 -carbaldehyde (1), tetradecane-7-thiol (2), 1-nonene (3), heptylamine (4), 3-heptyl-4-methyl-2-thiazolone (5), 3-heptyl-4-methyl-2-thiothiazolone (6), 5-[2-(3-heptyl-4-methylthiazolidene)]-2-penten-l-aldehyde (7), gamma-(3-heptyl-4-methyl-2-thiazolidene)crotonic acid (8) and 3,5-di (4-methyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,4-pentadienic acid (9). The quantum yield of singlet oxygen (1O2 (1deltag)) derived from VL-promoted platonin formed heptyl and heptyl cation radicals together with the photodegradation products described above. In isolated rat hepatocytes, platonin was cytotoxic under VL irradiation, whereas non-irradiated platonin was less cytotoxic and improved cell viability. The effects of oxygen uptake and cell viability of photolysis photoproducts of platonin, 3-heptyl-2,4-dimethylthiazolium iodide (HDT) and 3-heptyl-4-methylthiazolium iodide (HMT) were compared with those of platonin. These compounds, particularly the former, showed greater cytotoxicity and brought about less oxygen uptake than the latter. Radical-scavenging activities of platonin using an induction period method demonstrated that fully oxidized platonin had a stoichiometric factor (n) of 4. Platonin was a potent peroxy-radical scavenger. The dual modulation activity of platonin as a prooxidant and an antioxidant under VL irradiation was revealed by monitoring the oxygen uptake in isolated rat hepatocytes. This antioxidant/prooxidant activity of platonin may induce diverse effective pharmacological activities in biological systems. In the light of recent developments in studies of platonin and related compounds, the VL-promoted photooxygenation, photodegradation, antioxidant activity and biological activity of platonin are discussed.",,,"Animals, Antioxidants, Cell Survival, Hepatocytes, Humans, Kinetics, Models, Molecular, Oxygen Consumption, Photosensitizing Agents, Singlet Oxygen, Thiazoles",,

17417015,Identification of clock genes using difference gel electrophoresis.,"Proteomics is the study of the complete set of proteins encoded by the genome. The study of the proteome involves the investigation of changes in protein abundance, localization, involvement in multiprotein complexes, and detection of different protein isoforms and posttranslational modifications under defined conditions, such as the circadian cycle. This type of approach complements comparative gene expression studies providing additional information with respect to posttranscriptional processing. One of the key techniques used to study the proteome is two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. This technique has the ability to separate complex protein mixtures with high resolution. A significant improvement in this technology has been development of difference gel electrophoresis. Here, proteins are first labeled with one of three spectrally resolvable fluorescent cyanine dyes before being separated in two dimensions according to their charge and size, respectively. Multiplexing can accurately and reproducibly quantify protein expression across multiple gels. A multiple-gel approach allows the detection of differentially expressed protein spots using statistical methods to compare expression across different experimental groups. The proteins can be subsequently identified by mass spectrometric methods.

Herein we describe a series of fluorinated analogues of the dye thiazole orange that exhibit improved fluorescence quantum yields and photostabilities. In addition, computational studies on these dyes revealed that twisting about the monomethine bridge beyond an interplanar angle of 60 degrees leads to a dark state that decays nonradiatively to the ground state, accounting for the observed fluorogenic behavior. The effects of position and number of fluorine substituents correlate with both observed quantum yield and calculated activation energy for twisting beyond this critical angle.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Models, Molecular, Molecular Conformation, Photochemistry, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",,

We now report that such an induced helical poly(phenylacetylene) with a controlled helix sense can selectively trap an achiral benzoxazole cyanine dye among various structurally similar cyanine dyes within its hydrophobic helical cavity inside the polymer in acidic water, resulting in the formation of supramolecular helical aggregates, which exhibit an induced circular dichroism (ICD) in the cyanine dye chromophore region. The supramolecular chirality induced in the cyanine aggregates could be further memorized when the template helical polymer lost its optical activity and further inverted into the opposite helicity.

17295461,Characterization of photoinduced isomerization and intersystem crossing of the cyanine dye Cy3.,"Several important photophysical properties of the cyanine dye Cy3 have been determined by laser flash photolysis.

Furthermore, the triplet-state extinction coefficient and quantum yield of Cy3 are also measured via triplet-triplet energy-transfer method and comparative actinometry, respectively. It is found that the triplet --> triplet (T1-->Tn) absorptions of trans-Cy3 largely overlap the ground-state absorption of cis-Cy3. Unlike what occurred in Cy5, we have not observed the triplet-state T1-->Tn absorption of cis-Cy3 and the phosphorescence from triplet state of cis-Cy3 following a singlet excitation (S0-S1) of trans-Cy3, indicating the absence of a lowest cis-triplet state as an isomerization intermediate upon excitation in Cy3.

17293780,Development of a microarray chip for gene expression in rabbit ocular research.,"To develop a microarray for the rabbit that can be used for ocular gene expression research. Messenger RNA was isolated from anterior segment tissues (cornea, conjunctiva, and iris) and posterior segment tissues (lens, retina, and sclera) of rabbit eyes and used to create two independent cDNA libraries through the NEIBank project. Clones from each of these libraries were sequenced from both the 5' and 3' ends. These sequences and those from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) taxonomy database for rabbit were combined and electronically assembled into a set of unique nonoverlapping continuous sequences (contigs). For each contig, a homology search was performed using BLASTX and BLASTN against both the NCBI NR and NT databases to provide gene annotation. Unique contigs were sent to Agilent Technologies, where 60 base oligonucleotide probes were designed and synthesized, in situ, on two different arrays in an 8 array x 1900 element format. Glaucoma filtration surgery was performed on one eye of six rabbits. After 14 days, tissue was harvested from the conjunctiva and Tenon's capsule of both the surgically treated and untreated control eyes. Total RNA from each sample was labeled with cyanine dyes and hybridized to our custom microarrays. Of the 3,154 total probes present on the two arrays, 2,522 had a signal value above the background. The expression of 315 genes was significantly altered by glaucoma filtration surgery. Genes whose expression was altered included proteins associated with inflammatory response, defense response, and proteins involved in synthesis of the extracellular matrix. The results of this rabbit microarray study are consistent with those from other wound healing studies, indicating that this array can provide valid information on broad patterns of gene expression. This is the first microarray available for rabbit studies and is a valuable tool that can be used to study molecular events in the eye.",,,"Animals, Biomedical Research, Computer Systems, Eye, Filtering Surgery, Gene Expression, Gene Library, Glaucoma, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Rabbits",,
17266268,Binding of intercalating and groove-binding cyanine dyes to bacteriophage t5.,"The interaction between four related cyanine dyes and bacteriophage T5 is investigated with fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. The dyes, which differ in size, charge, and mode of DNA-binding, penetrate the capsid and bind the DNA inside. The rate of association decreases progressively with increasing dye size, from a few minutes for YO to more than 50 h for YOYO (at 37 degrees C). The relative affinity for the phage DNA is a factor of about 0.2 lower than for the same T5-DNA when free in solution. Comparison of groove-bound BOXTO-PRO and intercalating YO-PRO shows that the reduced affinity is not due to DNA extension but perhaps influenced by competition with other cationic DNA-binding agents inside the capsid. Although, the extent of dye binding to the phages decreases with increasing external ionic strength, the affinity relative to free DNA increases, which indicates a comparatively weak screening of electrostatic interactions inside the phage. The rate of binding increases with increasing ionic strength, reflecting an increase in effective pore size of the capsid as electrostatic interactions are screened and/or a faster diffusion of the dye through the DNA matrix inside the capsid as the DNA affinity is reduced. A combination of electron microscopy, light scattering, and linear dichroism show that the phages are intact after YO-PRO binding, whereas a small degree of capsid rupture cannot be excluded with BOXTO-PRO.",,,"Bacteriophages, Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Molecular Structure, Osmolar Concentration, Structure-Activity Relationship, Time Factors",,

17134205,Enhanced intra-aggregate charge separation from binary excitons in mixed J-aggregates of cyanine dyes.,"Well-ordered, two-dimensional, amalgamation-type J-aggregates consisting of two different kinds of structurally analogous anionic cyanine dyes were self-assembled on an amino-functionalized Au(111) electrode surface. Similar binary J-aggregates, though considerably less ordered in either one- or three-dimensional structure, could also be grown easily in a concentrated ( approximately 1.5 M) aqueous solution of NaCl. These binary J-aggregates are characterized by a singly peaked J-band associated with a unique molecular exciton shared by the two different dye components coherently. This cooperative binary excitonic state can live with substantial (more than 0.1 eV) energy gaps between the HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) levels of the two dyes mixed together. These energy gaps allow the binary exciton to relax very rapidly to an intra-aggregate charge-separated state in good competition with the metal-induced quenching of the excited-state energy. The enhanced charge separation leads to a high-efficiency photocurrent generation with a simple binary J-aggregate-coated Au(111) electrode in a reversible redox solution and results in strong quenching of the fluorescence from the corresponding aggregate grown in solution free from substrate-induced quenching.",,,,,
17024704,Exploring base-pair-specific optical properties of the DNA stain thiazole orange.,"Double-stranded DNA offers multiple binding sites to DNA stains. Measurements of noncovalently bound dye-nucleic acid complexes are, necessarily, measurements of an ensemble of chromophores. Thus, it is difficult to assign fluorescence properties to base-pair-specific binding modes of cyanine dyes or, vice versa, to obtain information about the local environment of cyanines in nucleic acids by using optical spectroscopy. The feasibility to stain DNA and simultaneously probe local perturbations by optical spectroscopy would be a valuable asset to nucleic acid research. So-called FIT probes (forced intercalation probes) were used to pinpoint the location of the DNA stain thiazole orange (TO) in PNADNA duplexes. A detailed analysis of the base-pair dependence of optical properties is provided and enforced binding of TO is compared with ""classical"" binding of free TO-PRO1. UV-visible absorbance, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy, and melting-curve analyses confirmed site-specific TO intercalation. Thiazole orange exhibited base-specific responses that are not observed in noncovalent dye-nucleic acid complexes, such as an extraordinary dependence of the TO extinction coefficient (+/-60 % variation of the averaged epsilon(max) of 57,000 M(-1) cm(-1)) on nearest-neighbor base pairs. TO signals hybridization, as shown by increases in the steady-state fluorescence emission. Studies of TO fluorescence lifetimes in FIT-PNA and in DNADNA and PNADNA complexes highlighted four different fluorescence-decay processes that may be closed or opened in response to matched or single-mismatched hybridization. A very fast decay process (0.04-0.07 ns) and a slow decay process (2.33-3.95 ns) provide reliable monitors of hybridization, and the opening of a fast decay channel (0.22-0.48 ns) that resulted in an attenuation of the fluorescence emission is observed upon the formation of mismatched base pairs.",,,"Base Pairing, Base Sequence, Benzothiazoles, Circular Dichroism, DNA, Quinolines, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Time Factors, Transition Temperature",,

At the core of the technology described in this paper, is the exciton concept that is relevant to molecular aggregation. J-aggregates of cyanine dyes have a narrower, red-shifted absorption band compared to monomer. We demonstrate that self-assembly may be driven by the helicogenic nature of the cyanine dye, converting the linear polymers of hyaluronic acid or carboxymethyl cellulose into supramolecular helical assemblies. This self-assembly is accompanied by an intense, sharp, red-shifted J-aggregate fluorescence. We utilized this property to develop an assay for the enzyme hyaluronidase, based upon the concept of ""scaffold destruction,"" whereby the disruption/destruction of the hyaluronic acid polymer by hyaluronidase is accompanied by an attenuation of light emission from the J-aggregate. The extent of light attenuation provides an index of hyaluronidase activity. Other polymers of carbohydrates, proteins, nucleic acids and chemical polymers (such as the carbon nanotube) might provide a similar scaffold for helicogenic dyes upon which molecular aggregation can occur. A key feature of these assays is that they are label-free.",,,"Fluorescence, Hyaluronoglucosaminidase, Photochemistry, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet",,
17000293,Proteomics of cerebral injury in a neonatal model of cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest.,"Concern over neurologic injury limits safe duration of deep hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA) in surgery for congenital cardiac disease. Proteomics is a novel and powerful technique to study global protein changes in a given protein system. Using a neonatal model of cardiopulmonary bypass with DHCA, we sought to characterize the protein changes associated with DHCA brain injury. Ten neonatal piglets were randomized to cardiopulmonary bypass with DHCA or sham operation. DHCA animals underwent induction of bypass (100 mL x kg(-1) x min(-1)), cooling to 18 degrees C, then DHCA for 60 minutes. Animals were rewarmed to normothermia, weaned from bypass, and harvested after 30 minutes off bypass. Sham animals underwent sternotomy without further instrumentation. Plasma samples were taken before bypass and before harvest. Proteins differentially expressed in the cerebral neocortex between the 2 groups were determined by 2-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis using fluorescent cyanine dyes and mass spectrometry. A second group of 4 piglets were similarly randomized and, after the experiment, tissues underwent perfusion-fixation for histologic examination. Cardiopulmonary bypass with DHCA caused extensive histologic and ultrastructural cerebral injury. Proteomic analysis of cerebral cortex found 10 protein spots to be differentially expressed; 9 were identified by mass spectrometry to represent 6 proteins, including apolipoprotein A-1, neurofilament-M protein, and enolase. Decreased expression of plasma apolipoprotein A-1 was found in DHCA. The acute protein changes associated with cerebral injury in a neonatal model of cardiopulmonary bypass with DHCA have been characterized.

The reaction proceeded efficiently to replace the meso-chlorine atom with a carboxy-functionalized aryl moiety and afforded the desired compounds in high yields. This methodology is particularly attractive due to its versatility and the utilization of environmentally friendly water as solvent. The new compounds possess excellent spectral properties and readily label bioactive molecules on solid support. The results demonstrate the potential of using the new compounds as fluorescent antennae for molecular imaging, spectroscopy, microscopy, and chemical or biological molecular recognition studies.",,,"Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Fluorescence, Infrared Rays, Molecular Probes, Spectrum Analysis, Water",,

The purpose of the present study was to analyze global hippocampal protein changes 2 weeks after a moderate ipsilateral controlled cortical impact in postnatal day 17 rats using 2-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Paired sham and ipsilateral injured hippocampal lysates were independently labeled with different fluorescent cyanine dyes and coseparated within the same immobilized pH gradient strips and slab gel based on isoelectric point and molecular mass.

Here, we explore the use of ProteomIQ Blue as a post-stain method for the visualization of fluorescent stained/labeled proteins. We show that ProteomIQ Blue post-staining is almost as sensitive as staining with SYPRO Ruby or cyanine dyes alone. More than 90% of the protein spots that are stained with the fluorescent stains are still detectable with ProteomIQ Blue. In protein identification by mass spectrometry, ProteomIQ Blue post-stained spots provide high sensitivity and high protein sequence coverage of the peptide mass maps in both MALDI-TOF-MS and ESI-MS/MS analyses. In conclusion, post-staining of fluorescent stained gels with ProteomIQ Blue provides a facile and a powerful method to achieve quantitative protein analysis as well as protein identification in the same semianalytical gel without requiring sophisticated/expensive robotic equipment.",,,"Bacterial Proteins, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Fluorescent Dyes, Organometallic Compounds, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization, Staining and Labeling",,
16833818,Kinetics of salt-induced J-aggregation of cyanine dyes.,"The addition of monovalent, divalent, and trivalent metal ions to three anionic ethyl meso-thiacarbocyanine dyes, an ethyl meso-oxacarbocyanine, and an imidacarbocyanine in aqueous solution at room temperature results in the production of J-aggregates within the range of tens to hundreds of seconds. The rate of formation of J-aggregates correlates with the rate of decay of dimers or monomers and is dependent on the type of metal ion, dye structure, and temperature. The rate of formation of J-aggregates increases as the temperature decreases and the dye and salt concentrations increase, and the rate is highest for trivalent ions and smallest for monovalent ions, independent of the type of anion. The time course of formation of J-aggregates is described in most cases by a sigmoidal curve, and the kinetics and mechanism are discussed within the framework of autocatalysis. Computer simulations reveal that the sigmoidal time dependence is transferred to an exponential-like curve by substantially increasing the rate constant for the noncatalytic step. The reaction pathway into J-aggregates can be switched from dimeric ion pairs as the reactant to monomeric ion pairs, when the rate constant for the catalytic step via the monomer becomes larger with respect to that via the dimer.",,,"Carbocyanines, Computer Simulation, Imines, Kinetics, Molecular Structure, Salts, Spectrum Analysis, Temperature",,
16833479,Solvent-dependent vibrational frequencies and reorganization energies of two merocyanine chromophores.,"Absorption and resonance Raman spectra have been measured over a wide range of solvents for two merocyanine dyes containing the indoline (""Fischer"" base) electron donor group with different accepting groups. One appears to be near the cyanine limit (equal contributions of the neutral and zwitterionic resonance forms to both ground- and excited-state structures) based on electrooptic absorption data showing a very small dipole moment change upon electronic excitation. The resonance Raman spectra of both molecules show significant frequency shifts and intensity redistributions that evolve monotonically with increasing solvent polarity and are consistent with increasing zwitterionic character of the ground-state structure. The vibrational reorganization energies of both molecules, obtained by simulating the absorption band shapes, are smaller in polar solvents than in nonpolar or weakly polar ones, consistent with a more cyanine-like structure at higher solvent polarities. However, the vibrational reorganization energies of both molecules exceed 700 cm(-1) in all solvents, larger than in many true cyanine dyes, and the optical absorption maxima do not correlate well with either solvent polarity or vibrational reorganization energy. This indicates some limitations to the structural conclusions that can be reached from the two-state model for pi-conjugated donor-acceptor systems.",,,,,

16785642,Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.,"The two-dimensional (2D) polyacrylamide gel-based approach to protein profiling has been successful because it is an accessible, inexpensive, and powerful tool for the analysis of global patterns of protein expression. All protein spots that are resolved and detected within the 104 to 105 dynamic range of gel capacity can be studied qualitatively and quantitatively in relation to each other, and viewed as a single image. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) has strengthened the 2D platform by allowing the detection and quantitation of differences between samples resolved on the same gel, or across multiple gels, when linked by an internal standard. The technology is based on modification of protein extracts with fluorescent cyanine dyes, which have distinct excitation and emission spectra and are migration (charge and size) matched so that the same protein labeled with any of the dyes (Cy2, Cy3, Cy5) will migrate to the same position within a 2D gel, greatly enhancing reproducibility. It is becoming clear that each technology that is currently available for quantifying differential protein expression has its own weaknesses and strengths, and that multiplatform, integrated approaches will be necessary to provide the most complete analysis of any given proteome. We believe that DIGE is, and will remain in the future, a key front-end proteomic tool that will strongly complement other protein-profiling technologies.",,,"Animals, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Isoelectric Focusing, Proteome, Proteomics, Trypsin",,
16774193,Excitation energy transfer in ion pairs of polymethine cyanine dyes: efficiency and dynamics.,"The present work deals with singlet excitation energy transfer (EET) occurring in contact ion pairs (CIPs) of several anionic oxonol analogues (acting as EE donors) and cationic cyanines (acting as acceptors) characterized by off resonance individual transitions. Combining conductometric and spectroscopic measurements with decreasing solvent polarity, we were able to observe a progressive ion pairing leading first to solvent-separated ion pairs (SSIPs) and then to CIPs. Analysis of the absorption spectra of three selected salts (A2,C1, A2,C2, and A1,C4) in chloroform-toluene mixtures showed that the transformation of SSIP into CIP involves the appearance of a certain exciton coupling, the extent of which decreases regularly with increasing gap between the local excitation energies. Fluorescence excitation spectra showed that EET occurs in CIP, and EET efficiencies were evaluated with a procedure expressly devised for weakly emitting donors. These were between 0.2 and 0.65 for the examined ion pairs involving anions A1 and A2. The spectroscopic study was complemented by a theoretical investigation aimed at establishing the dynamic regime of the observed EET. From classical MD simulations and local full geometry optimizations, A2,C1 and A2,C2 were found to form rather stable sandwich-type CIP structures with interchromophore distances (R) of about 0.45-0.50 nm. The donor-acceptor electronic coupling was calculated in terms of Coulombic interactions between atomic transition charges. For CIP, the electronic coupling was decidedly beyond the limit of the weak coupling required for an incoherent Förster-type mechanism. Thus, we tried to arrange the EET dynamics within the theory developed by Kimura, Kakitani, and Yamato (J. Phys. Chem. B 2000, 104, 9276) for the intermediate coupling case, which provides analytical expressions of time-dependent occupation probability, EET rate, and coherency in terms of two basic quantities: the electronic coupling and a correlation time related to the Franck-Condon factor. The latter was shown to be primarily modulated by Förster's spectral overlap integral (related in turn to the excitation energy gap). Calculations were carried out for the three sample systems using three values of the electronic coupling roughly corresponding to CIP, 1.0, and 2.0 nm interchromophore distances. At the CIP distance, EET in both A2,C1 and A2,C2 was predicted to occur with a partial exciton mechanism, very short transfer times (about 10 fs), and high degree of coherence. In A1,C4 (having the largest energy gap), EET was found to occur with a hot-transfer mechanism. More or less hot-transfer dynamics appeared to be retained by all three systems at R = 1.0 nm. Fully incoherent EET appeared to become operative only at distances larger than 2.0 nm.",,,,,

Studies of mPPE-Ala in methanol/water solvent mixtures show that the polymer folds into a helical conformation, and the extent of helical folding increases with the volume % water in the solvent. The presence of the helical conformation is signaled by the appearance of a broad, excimer-like visible fluorescence band, combined with a strong bisignate circular dichroism signal in the region of the pi,pi absorption of the polymer backbone. The circular dichroism signal exhibits negative chirality, suggesting that the left-handed (M-form) of the helix is in enantiomeric excess. Binding of the metallointercalator [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ (where bpy = 2,2-bipyridine and dppz = dipyrido[3,2-a:2',3'-c]phenazine) with the helical polymer is accompanied by the appearance of the orange-red photoluminescence from the metal complex. This effect is directly analogous to that observed when [Ru(bpy)2(dppz)]2+ binds to DNA via intercalation, suggesting that the metal complex binds to mPPE-Ala by intercalating between the pi-stacked phenylene ethynylene residues. Cationic cyanine dyes also bind to the periphery of the helical polymer in a manner that is interpreted as ""groove binding"". A circular dichroism signal is observed that is believed to arise from exciton coupling within the chiral cyanine dye chromophore aggregate that is formed as the dye molecules are oriented by the helical mPPE-Ala ""template"".",,,,,
16624475,"Comparing mono- and divalent DNA groove binding cyanine dyes -- binding geometries, dissociation rates, and fluorescence properties.","The unsymmetrical cyanine dyes BOXTO-PRO and BOXTO-MEE were derived from the DNA groove binder BOXTO, by adding a positively charged or a non-ionic hydrophilic tail to BOXTO, respectively. The main objective was to obtain more efficient DNA probes, for instance in electrophoresis and microscopy, by slowing down the dissociation of BOXTO from DNA. The interactions with mixed sequence DNA was studied with fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopy, stopped-flow dissociation and gel electrophoresis. Both the derivatives are groove bound as BOXTO, and have similar fluorescence properties when bound to mixed sequence DNA in free solution. BOXTO-PRO exhibits a slower dissociation than BOXTO from DNA, whereas the dissociation rate for BOXTO-MEE is faster and, unexpectedly independent of the ionic strength. During gel electrophoresis both BOXTO-PRO and BOXTO-MEE exhibit a faster dissociation rate than BOXTO. Still, BOXTO-PRO seems to be a good alternative as DNA probe, especially for applications in free solution where the dissociation is slower than for the corresponding intercalator TOPRO-1.",,,"Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, DNA, DNA Probes, Electrophoresis, Agar Gel, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Kinetics, Osmolar Concentration, Spectrum Analysis",,
16570972,Adsorption of cyanine dyes on gold nanoparticles and formation of J-aggregates in the nanoparticle assembly.,"This paper describes the results of an investigation of the interparticle interactions and reactivities in the assembly of gold nanoparticles mediated by cyanine dyes. The combination of the positively charged indolenine cyanine dyes and the negatively charged gold nanoparticles is shown to form a J-aggregate bridged assembly of nanoparticles, in addition to hydrophobic interparticle and electrostatic dye-particle interactions. Such interparticle interactions and reactivities are studied by probing the absorption of J-aggregates and fluorescence from the dyes and the surface plasmon resonance absorption from the nanoparticles. The J-aggregation of the dyes adsorbed on the nanoparticles is shown to play an important role in the assembly of nanoparticles. The spectral evolution of the J-band of the dyes and the surface plasmon resonance band of the nanoparticles was found to be sensitive to the nature of the charge and the structure of the dyes. The fluorescence quenching for the dyes was shown to be quantitatively related to the surface coverage of the dyes on the nanocrystal surfaces. These findings have provided important information for assessing a two-step process involving a rapid adsorption of the dyes on the nanoparticles and a subsequent assembly of the nanoparticles involving a combination of interparticle J-aggregation and hydrophobic interactions of the adsorbed dyes. The results are discussed in terms of the structural effects of the dyes, and the interparticle molecular interactions and reactivities, which provide important physical and chemical insights into the design of dye-nanoparticle structured functional nanomaterials.",,,"Adsorption, Carbocyanines, Gold, Metal Nanoparticles, Microscopy, Electron, Transmission, Molecular Structure, Spectrophotometry, Static Electricity",,

The DNA sequence selectivity of the probe was characterized, as were the changes in photophysical properties of the dye upon covalent linkage to the peptide to assess whether such bioconjugates could function as molecular probes of gene sequences. The oxazole yellow-peptide bioconjugate exhibits DNA recognition and binding affinity comparable to the native Hin recombinase protein. Examination of photophysical effects to dye conjugation indicates a negligible affect on the fluorescence quantum yield. Fluorescence studies indicate this molecular probe is useful to determine the presence of a given DNA target sequence and gives negligible fluorescence in the absence of a given target site.

These new disulfide-based protecting groups were introduced onto the epsilon-amino group of L-lysine; the resulting amino acid derivatives were easily converted into N alpha-Fmoc building blocks suitable for both solid- and solution-phase peptide synthesis. Model dipeptide(Ardec)s were prepared by using classical peptide couplings followed by standard deprotection protocols. They were used to optimize the conditions for complete thiolytic removal of the Ardec groups both in aqueous and organic media. Phdec and Pydec were found to be cleaved within 15 to 30 min under mild reducing conditions: i) by treatment with dithiothreitol or beta-mercaptoethanol in Tris.HCl buffer (pH 8.5-9.0) for deprotection in water and ii) by treatment with beta-mercaptoethanol and 1,8-diazobicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) in N-methylpyrrolidinone for deprotection in an organic medium. Successful solid-phase synthesis of hexapeptides Ac-Lys-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-Lys(Ardec)-NH2 has clearly demonstrated the full orthogonality of these new amino protecting groups with Fmoc and Boc protections. The utility of the Ardec orthogonal deprotection strategy for site-specific chemical modification of peptides bearing several amino groups was illustrated firstly by the preparation of a fluorogenic substrate for caspase-3 protease containing the cyanine dyes Cy 3.0 and Cy 5.0 as FRET donor/acceptor pair, and by solid-phase synthesis of an hexapeptide bearing a single biotin reporter group.",,,"Amines, Biochemistry, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Lysine, Peptides, Solutions, Sulfhydryl Compounds, Urethane",,

Addition of gelatin at concentrations of 0.0005-0.05 wt % to solutions of dyes results in the production of J-aggregates in the tens of seconds to tens of minutes range. The rate of J-aggregate formation increases with increasing concentrations of dye and gelatin, correlates with the rate of decay of dimers, and is also dependent on the dye structure, temperature, and pH. The rate of J-aggregation is increased for and decreased for with an increase in temperature. For and, the rate increases with increasing [H+] and reaches the maximum value at pH 3.3-4.3 for 3. The interaction of with gelatin is considered to be a cooperative binding process, and J-aggregation is characterized by the time-dependent rate constant.

16466783,LightUp probes in clinical diagnostics.,"The LightUp Probe technology has now matured and reached the phase where it has been implemented in commercial reagent kits, i.e. the ReSSQ product line. Several properties of the LightUp probes make them particularly suitable for clinical settings. For instance, extraordinary shelf life and a chemical stability that allows convenient fridge storage. The origin of the higher stability of LightUp probe kits compared to others, based on alternative probe technologies, is partly the relatively good stability of cyanine dyes but also the resistance towards nucleases and proteases of the synthetic DNA analogue peptide nucleic acid that is used as the sequence recognizing element in LightUp probes. It is clear from recent trends in the PCR amplification hardware technology that the instrumentation is becoming more flexible and less adapted for dedicated probe chemistries. This will pave the way for increased standardization in the field of DNA diagnostics and the development of cross-platform assays.

Different cyanine dyes such as thiocyanine, quinocyanine, and thiazole orange isomers were obtained. In the case of unsymmetrical cyanines, the linker was attached to either the quinoline or the benzothiazole nucleus. The influence of the ODN counterpart was evaluated by linking the cyanines to the 5'-end or to an internucleotidic phosphate. In the first case, the influence of neighboring nucleic bases was studied, whereas in the second, the stereochemical configuration at the phosphorus atom bearing the cyanine was investigated.

Forty mice, 20 with Lyme arthritis and 20 controls, were examined. Two nonspecific NIR carbocyanine dyes, indocyanine green (ICG) and a hydrophilic carbocyanine derivative (1,1'-bis-[4-sulfobutyl] indotricarbocyanine-5,5'-dicarboxylic acid diglucamide monosodium salt [SIDAG]), were administered intravenously at two doses. Fluorescence images were acquired before and during 120 seconds after injection of cyanine dyes. For both dyes, the area under the curve (AUC) was determined for the interval between 40 and 80 seconds after injection. In addition, the slope of the signal decrease was compared among animal groups. Results were compared with histological findings. The general temporal fluorescence intensity course for ICG was characterized by a rapid increase, with a peak at 40-50 seconds followed by a decrease; conversely for SIDAG, by a slow increase. AUC analysis for both dyes showed that the fluorescence signal differed significantly between controls and arthritic animals (P < .05). Within these groups, there were significant differences between the two doses investigated. ICG differed significantly between control and arthritic animals in the slope of the signal decrease for both doses investigated (P < .05). Histological examination showed early stages of inflammation in arthritic animals.

It was found from the absorption spectra and NMR results that there are two isomers in the ground state of these dyes. Steady-state fluorescence spectra show that the fluorescence intensities of dye A and dye B are enhanced and quenched by TiO(2) colloids, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence lifetime measurements indicate that the lifetimes of dye A and dye B in the presence of TiO(2) colloids are longer and shorter than those obtained in the absence of TiO(2) colloids, respectively. ESR measurements demonstrate that the electron transfer efficiency from (1)dye B* to the conduction band of TiO(2) is much larger than that from (1)dye A* to the conduction band of TiO(2). The different fluorescence behavior of dye A and dye B can be intepreted in terms of whether phi(Tr,nr)(0)-phi(Tr,nr) (the reduction of the quantum yield for radiationless transition in the excited singlet state (1)dye* caused by the TiO(2) colloids) is larger or smaller than phi(ET) (the quantum yield of electron transfer from (1)dye* to the conduction band of TiO(2) colloids).",,,,,

To obtain overall proteome profiles during animal development, a small free-living soil nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, was used as a model and the developmental changes of protein expressions were analyzed using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. Protein samples from six developmental stages were prelabeled with fluorescent cyanine dyes and separated on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels. Image-to-image analysis of protein abundances together with protein identification by peptide mass fingerprinting yielded the developmental expression profiles of 231 spots representing 165 proteins. About a quarter of the identified proteins were expressed in multiple spots with different isoelectric points, suggesting a certain proportion of proteins were variously modified. This notion was supported by the observation that about a third of the multispot proteins were stained positive for a phosphoprotein specific dye. While a fairly large number of the proteins showed little alteration in their expression profiles during development, about 40 proteins were found to be significantly either up- or down-regulated between the embryos and newly hatched L1 larvae. Down-regulated proteins included those related to the cell cycle such as MCM-7, PCN-1, and the mitotic checkpoint protein, while up-regulated proteins included structural proteins such as actins, LEV-11, DIM-1, VAB-21, metabolic enzymes such as ATP synthase, ALH-12, fluctose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and GPD-3, and galectins.

We have optimised conditions for labelling of nonreduced, denatured samples and report increased sensitivity for a subset of thiol-containing proteins, allowing accurate monitoring of redox-dependent thiol modifications and expression changes. Cysteine labelling was then combined with lysine labelling in a multiplex 2-D DIGE proteomic study of redox-dependent and ErbB2-dependent changes in epithelial cells exposed to oxidative stress. This study identifies differentially modified proteins involved in cellular redox regulation, protein folding, proliferative suppression, glycolysis and cytoskeletal organisation, revealing the complexity of the response to oxidative stress and the impact that overexpression of ErbB2 has on this response.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Cysteine, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Epithelial Cells, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, erbB-2, Image Processing, Computer-Assisted, Lysine, Molecular Chaperones, Oxidation-Reduction, Oxidative Stress, Proteins, Sensitivity and Specificity, Sequence Analysis",,
15945376,Evaluation of the performance of two carbodiimide-based cyanine dyes for detecting changes in mRNA expression with DNA microarrays.,"Microarrays have been extensively used to investigate genome-wide expression patterns. Although this technology has been tremendously successful, several practical issues would benefit from improvements in design. Here we describe a novel, efficient labeling methodology that uses carbodiimide-linked cyanine dyes to directly chemically label cDNA derived from mouse total RNA. Using this protocol, it takes only 10 min at 70 degrees C to complete the cDNA labeling reaction. The directly labeled cDNAs can then be hybridized to 70-mer mouse oligonucleotide arrays for expression profiling studies. Microarray analyses indicate that these cDNAs are uniformly labeled and produce higher signal intensities than conventional enzymatic direct labeling methods and comparable signal intensities to those obtained by conventional indirect labeling methods. Furthermore, verification of our microarray data using a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) method indicates good agreement between the two methods. Thus, we conclude that our simplified cyanine-carbodiimide labeling method, which does not rely on the incorporation of modified nucleotides, will provide a reliable, quicker, and potentially cheaper alternative to established labeling techniques for gene expression analyses.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Carbodiimides, DNA, Complementary, Fluorescent Dyes, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence, Mice, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, RNA, Messenger, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Staining and Labeling",,
15863482,Cyanine dyes as intercalating agents: kinetic and thermodynamic studies on the DNA/Cyan40 and DNA/CCyan2 systems.,"The interaction of cyanines with nucleic acids is accompanied by intense changes of their optical properties. Consequently these molecules find numerous applications in biology and medicine. Since no detailed information on the binding mechanism of DNA/cyanine systems is available, a T-jump investigation of the kinetics and equilibria of binding of the cyanines Cyan40 [3-methyl-2-(1,2,6-trimethyl-4(1H)pyridinylidenmethyl)-benzothiazolium ion] and CCyan2 [3-methyl-2-[2-methyl-3-(3-methyl-2(3H)-benzothiazolylidene)-1-propenyl]-benzothiazolium ion] with CT-DNA is performed at 25 degrees C, pH 7 and various ionic strengths. Bathochromic shifts of the dye absorption band upon DNA addition, polymer melting point displacement (DeltaT = 8-10 degrees C), site size determination (n = 2), and stepwise kinetics concur in suggesting that the investigated cyanines bind to CT-DNA primary by intercalation. Measurements with poly(dA-dT).poly(dA-dT) and poly(dG-dC).poly(dG-dC) reveal fair selectivity of CCyan2 toward G-C basepairs. T-jump experiments show two kinetic effects for both systems. The binding process is discussed in terms of the sequence D + S left arrow over right arrow D,S left arrow over right arrow DS(I) left arrow over right arrow DS(II), which leads first to fast formation of an external complex D,S and then to a partially intercalated complex DS(I) which, in turn, converts to DS(II), a more stable intercalate. Absorption spectra reveal that both dyes tend to self-aggregate; the kinetics of CCyan2 self-aggregation is studied by T-jump relaxation and the results are interpreted in terms of dimer formation.",,,"Animals, Carbocyanines, Cattle, DNA, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Fluorescent Dyes, Hot Temperature, Hydrogen-Ion Concentration, Intercalating Agents, Ions, Kinetics, Models, Chemical, Nucleotides, Polymers, Salts, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Temperature, Thermodynamics, Thymus Gland, Time Factors",,

The scope of the previously reported catch-and-release method using sulfonyl chloride resin(1) has now been extended to include pentamethine and water-soluble cyanine dyes. We also report a new and chemically distinct synthetic strategy, employing the stepwise attack of heterocyclic carbon nucleophiles on immobilized polyene-chain precursors, allowing the clean synthesis of hydrophobic and hydrophilic trimethine and pentamethine dyes from more easily obtained starting materials.

15761955,Saturation labeling with cysteine-reactive cyanine fluorescent dyes provides increased sensitivity for protein expression profiling of laser-microdissected clinical specimens.,"Laser capture microdissection (LCM) provides the capability to isolate and analyze small numbers of cells from a specific area of a histologic section. LCM has particular value for analysis of early stage tumors, which are often small and intermixed with non-tumor tissue. It has previously been shown that a new generation of cysteine-reactive cyanine dyes can, in principle, provide increased sensitivity for two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) profiling when sample quantitities are limiting. However, the comparative advantage of the new dyes in a clinical setting has not been established. Here, we report that cysteine-reactive dyes allowed the identification of more features than established, lysine-reactive dyes with a given number of cells. This was true both with extracts prepared from human papillomavirus E6 and E7-transduced human keratinocytes, a model for early-stage cervical cancer, and with LCM samples. In an experiment comparing LCM clinical samples of gastric adenocarcinoma versus precancerous, spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM) from the same patient, cysteine labeling allowed the identification of more than 1000 discrete protein spots in samples containing 5000 cells. This is a 5- to 50-fold smaller sample than used in previous studies. Both labeling methods had a comparable success rate for protein identification by mass spectrometry (MS). The proteins associated with more than 40 differentially abundant spots in the clinical samples were identified by MS. In this exploratory analysis, changes in expression levels of cytoskeletal proteins, molecular chaperones, and cell-signaling proteins were seen. The identification of a number of proteins that are potentially relevant to tumor progression suggests that the method holds promise for biomarker discovery.",,,"Adenocarcinoma, Biomarkers, Carbocyanines, Cells, Cultured, Cysteine, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Keratinocytes, Lasers, Microdissection, Proteomics, Staining and Labeling, Stomach Neoplasms",,
15744836,Application of partial least squares discriminant analysis to two-dimensional difference gel studies in expression proteomics.,"Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE) is a tool for measuring changes in protein expression between samples involving pre-electrophoretic labeling ith cyanine dyes. In multi-gel experiments, univariate statistical tests have been used to identify differential expression between sample types by looking for significant changes in spot volume. Multivariate statistical tests, which look for correlated changes between sample types, provide an alternate approach for identifying spots with differential expression. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a multivariate statistical approach, was combined with an iterative threshold process to identify which protein spots had the greatest contribution to the model, and compared to univariate test for three datasets. This included one dataset where no biological difference was expected. The novel multivariate approach, detailed here, represents a method to complement the univariate approach in identification of differentially expressed protein spots. This new approach has the advantages of reduced risk of false-positives and the identification of spots that are significantly altered in terms of correlated expression rather than absolute expression values.",,,"Analysis of Variance, Animals, Bacterial Proteins, Brain Chemistry, Carbocyanines, Circadian Rhythm, Coloring Agents, Discriminant Analysis, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, False Positive Reactions, Humans, Least-Squares Analysis, Liver, Mice, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Proteomics, Schizophrenia, Software",,
15690453,Time-resolved electrophoretic analysis of mobility shifts for dissociating DNA ligands.,"Intercalative binding of ligands to DNA can be demonstrated by helix unwinding, monitored by gel electrophoresis of supercoiled DNA, as electrophoretic mobility is sensitive to the topological DNA state. However, we show that an apparent lack of unwinding in an electrophoretic assay could be due to dissociation of the (intercalated) ligand during the analysis, rather than evidence for a nonintercalative mode of binding to DNA. Repetitive scanning during the electrophoresis ensures that release of the ligand during electrophoresis does not affect the measured degree of unwinding, based on the electrophoretic velocity being determined as a function of time. We use this assay to establish intercalation as a mode of binding to DNA for the cyanine dyes YO, YO-PRO as well as two enantiomeric forms of the ruthenium complexes [(phen)2 Ru(tatpp)Ru(phen)2]4+, and to support groove-binding for the new unsymmetrical cyanine dyes BOXTO and BOXTO-PRO. Groove-binding could be concluded from a lack of unwinding, because we could rule out that it is caused by release of the dye during the electrophoresis. The gel electrophoresis has the advantage over hydrodynamic techniques that much smaller sample amounts are required, and our time-resolved approach can be employed in all mobility-shift assays when applied to dissociating complexes.",,,"Benzoxazoles, DNA, DNA, Superhelical, Electrophoresis, Agar Gel, Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay, Fluorescent Dyes, Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings, Intercalating Agents, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Organometallic Compounds, Quinolines, Quinolinium Compounds, Stereoisomerism, Thiazoles",,

15615044,FRET studies of the interaction of dimeric cyanine dyes with DNA.,"Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a powerful tool to determine distances between chromophores bound to macromolecules, since the efficiency of the energy transfer from an initially excited donor to an acceptor strongly depends on the distance between the two dye molecules. The structure of the noncovalent complex of double-strand DNA (dsDNA) with thiazol orange dimers (TOTO) allows FRET analysis of two intercalated chromophores. By intercalation of two different TOTO dyes we observe an energy transfer from TOTO-1 as donor and TOTO-3 as acceptor. In this manner we are able to determine the mean distance between two proximate TOTO molecules bound to dsDNA. Thus the maximum number of binding positions for this type of intercalation dyes in the dsDNA can be obtained. Furthermore the dependency of the acceptor emission on the donor concentration is analysed. The emission of TOTO-3 reaches a maximum when the acceptor-to-donor ratio is 1:10.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Dimerization, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Quinolines, Quinolinium Compounds, Thiazoles",,

The dyes assemble into cofacial dimers within the minor groove of the DNA and assembly of one dimer facilitates assembly of additional dimers directly adjacent to the first. Growth of the polymer ceases when the end of the DNA is reached or when the DNA sequence blocks dimerization of the dye. Thus, this process can be thought of as a supramolecular analogue of a chain polymerization.

15593286,Nanoparticle energy transfer on the cell surface.,"Membrane topology of receptors plays an important role in shaping transmembrane signalling of cells. Among the methods used for characterizing receptor clusters, fluorescence resonance energy transfer between a donor and acceptor fluorophore plays a unique role based on its capability of detecting molecular level (2-10 nm) proximities of receptors in physiological conditions. Recent development of biotechnology has made possible the usage of colloidal gold particles in a large size range for specific labelling of cells for the purposes of electron microscopy. However, by combining metal and fluorophore labelling of cells, the versatility of metal-fluorophore interactions opens the way for new applications by detecting the presence of the metal particles by the methods of fluorescence spectroscopy. An outstanding feature of the metal nanoparticle-fluorophore interaction is that the metal particle can enhance spontaneous emission of the fluorophore in a distance-dependent fashion, in an interaction range essentially determined by the size of the nanoparticle. In our work enhanced fluorescence of rhodamine and cyanine dyes was observed in the vicinity of immunogold nanoparticles on the surface of JY cells in a flow cytometer. The dyes and the immunogold were targetted to the cell surface receptors MHCI, MHCII, transferrin receptor and CD45 by monoclonal antibodies. The fluorescence enhancement was sensitive to the wavelength of the exciting light, the size and amount of surface bound gold beads, as well as the fluorophore-nanoparticle distance. The intensity of 90 degrees scattering of the incident light beam was enhanced by the immunogold in a concentration and size-dependent fashion. The 90 degrees light scattering varied with the wavelength of the incident light in a manner characteristic to gold nanoparticles of the applied sizes. A reduction in photobleaching time constant of the cyanine dye was observed in the vicinity of gold particles in a digital imaging microscope. Modulations of 90 degrees light scattering intensity and photobleaching time constant indicate the role of the local field in the fluorescence enhancement. A mathematical simulation based on the electrodynamic theory of fluorescence enhancement showed a consistency between the measured enhancement values, the inter-epitope distances and the quantum yields. The feasibility of realizing proximity sensors operating at distance ranges larger than that of the conventional Forster transfer is demonstrated on the surface of living cells.",,,"Antibodies, Monoclonal, B-Lymphocytes, Carbocyanines, Cell Membrane, Cells, Cultured, Energy Transfer, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Fluorescent Dyes, Gold, Histocompatibility Antigens Class I, Histocompatibility Antigens Class II, Humans, Leukocyte Common Antigens, Nanotechnology, Receptors, Transferrin, Rhodamines, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
15546218,Synthesis and properties of fluorescent NF-kappa B-recognizing hairpin oligodeoxyribonucleotide decoys.,"Intramolecular fluorescence quenching of cyanine dyes was investigated using a model hairpin oligonucleotide decoy encoding a NF-kappaB p50 subunit binding site. Two types of hairpin oligonucleotides were synthesized: (1) 5'-(6-aminohexyl)- and 3'-(3-aminopropyl)-linked (I); (2) 5'-(6-aminohexyl)- and 3'-[3-(3-hydroxypropyldithio)propyl]-linked (II). Oligonucleotide I was covalently modified using monofunctional either Cy3- or Cy5.5-N-hydroxysuccinimide esters. Using reverse-phase HPLC, mono-and dicyanineamide derivatives of I were isolated. Mono-Cy3-modified derivatives of I, but not the mono-Cy5.5-modified derivatives, showed a 2-fold higher Cy3 fluorescence intensity compared to the free dye. There was no detectable difference in fluorescence between the di-Cy3 derivative of I and the free dye at the same concentration. However, there was a 4-fold quenching of fluorescence in the case of the di-Cy5.5 derivative of the same hairpin oligonucleotide. The quenching of Cy5.5 fluorescence could not be explained by the interaction of Cy5.5 with nucleotide bases as demonstrated by incubating free Cy5.5 dye with oligonuclotides. The quenching effect was further investigated using an oligonucleotide bearing a cleavable 3'-amino-terminated linker bearing an S-S bond (III). After modification of the 5'- and 3'-end of oligonucleotide III with a Cy5.5 monofunctional hydroxysuccinimide ester, a 70-75% quenching of fluorescence was observed. Fluorescence was 100% dequenched after the reduction of S-S bond. The obtained result unequivocally demonstrates that the formation of intramolecular Cy5.5 dimers is the dominant mechanism of fluorescence quenching in symmetric dye-dye hairpin decoy beacons.",,,"Fluorescent Dyes, NF-kappa B, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Oligodeoxyribonucleotides",,
15540805,J-aggregates on metal nanoparticles characterized through ultrafast spectroscopy and near-field optics.,"Illumination of metal nanoparticles at the plasmon resonance produces enhanced evanescent fields on the nanoparticles' surfaces. The unusual strength of the field makes it a target for exploring photoinduced phenomena at the nanoscale, if efficient functionalization or coating of the nanoparticle surface with appropriate chromophores is possible. One direction is to use cyanine dyes that form monolayers of J-aggregates on the surface of noble metal nanoparticle colloids. The unique, collective electronic properties of J-aggregates produce excitons with enormous extinction coefficients that are of interest for their efficient energy transfer, electron transfer, and nonlinear optical properties. In that vein, we report our results on time-resolved spectroscopy and near-field scanning optical microscopy (NSOM) of J-aggregate exciton dynamics on Ag and Au nanoparticle colloids. Ultrafast transient absorption studies show that J-aggregate exciton lifetimes on Ag nanoparticles are much longer than on Au nanoparticles, with a 300 ps lifetime that is two orders of magnitude longer than the electronic processes in the nanoparticles themselves. Complementary NSOM studies of the colloids show that fluorescence from the J-aggregates on the Ag nanoparticles is induced by the scanning probe. These results may be significant for improving the nanophotonic performance of hybrid materials for nanoscale applications.",,,,,
15520209,In vivo near-infrared fluorescence imaging of integrin alphavbeta3 in brain tumor xenografts.,"Noninvasive visualization of cell adhesion molecule alpha(v)beta(3) integrin expression in vivo has been well studied by using the radionuclide imaging modalities in various preclinical tumor models. A literature survey indicated no previous use of cyanine dyes as contrast agents for in vivo optical detection of tumor integrin. Herein, we report the integrin receptor specificity of novel peptide-dye conjugate arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-Cy5.5 as a contrast agent in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo. The RGD-Cy5.5 exhibited intermediate affinity for alpha(v)beta(3) integrin (IC(50) = 58.1 +/- 5.6 nmol/L). The conjugate led to elevated cell-associated fluorescence on integrin-expressing tumor cells and endothelial cells and produced minimal cell fluorescence when coincubated with c(RGDyK). In vivo imaging with a prototype three-dimensional small-animal imaging system visualized subcutaneous U87MG glioblastoma xenograft with a broad range of concentrations of fluorescent probe administered via the tail vein. The intermediate dose (0.5 nmol) produces better tumor contrast than high dose (3 nmol) and low dose (0.1 nmol) during 30 minutes to 24 hours postinjection, because of partial self-inhibition of receptor-specific tumor uptake at high dose and the presence of significant amount of background fluorescence at low dose, respectively. The tumor contrast was also dependent on the mouse viewing angles. Tumor uptake of RGD-Cy5.5 was blocked by unlabeled c(RGDyK). This study suggests that the combination of the specificity of RGD peptide/integrin interaction with near-infrared fluorescence detection may be applied to noninvasive imaging of integrin expression and monitoring anti-integrin treatment efficacy providing near real-time measurements.",,,"Animals, Brain Neoplasms, Carbocyanines, Cell Line, Tumor, Female, Fluorescence, Humans, Integrin alphaVbeta3, Mice, Mice, Nude, Neoplasm Transplantation, Oligopeptides, Transplantation, Heterologous",,
15493926,Amplified quenching of a conjugated polyelectrolyte by cyanine dyes.,"The conjugated polyelectrolyte PPESO3 features a poly(phenylene ethynylene) backbone substituted with anionic 3-sulfonatopropyloxy groups. PPESO3 is quenched very efficiently (KSV > 10(6) M(-1)) by cationic energy transfer quenchers in an amplified quenching process. In the present investigation, steady-state and picosecond time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy are used to examine amplified quenching of PPESO3 by a series of cyanine dyes via singlet-singlet energy transfer. The goal of this work is to understand the mechanism of amplified quenching and to characterize important parameters that govern the amplification process. Steady-state fluorescence quenching of PPESO3 by three cationic oxacarbocyanine dyes in methanol solution shows that the quenching efficiency does not correlate with the Forster radius computed from spectral overlap of the PPESO3 fluorescence with the cyanines' absorption. The quenching efficiency is controlled by the stability of the polymer-dye association complex. When quenching studies are carried out in water where PPESO3 is aggregated, changes observed in the absorption and fluorescence spectra of 1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindotricarbocyanine iodide (HMIDC) indicate that the polymer templates the formation of a J-aggregate of the dye. The fluorescence dynamics in the PPESO3/HMIDC system were probed by time-resolved upconversion and the results show that PPESO3 to HMIDC energy transfer occurs on two distinctive time scales. At low HMIDC concentration, the dynamics are dominated by an energy transfer pathway with a time scale faster than 4 ps. With increasing HMIDC concentration, an energy pathway with a time scale of 0.1-1 ns is active. The prompt pathway (tau < 4 ps) is attributed to quenching of delocalized PPESO3 excitons created near the HMIDC association site, whereas the slow phase is attributed to intra- and interchain exciton diffusion to the HMIDC.",,,,,
15362886,Improving the signal sensitivity and photostability of DNA hybridizations on microarrays by using dye-doped core-shell silica nanoparticles.,"The development of new highly sensitive and selective methods for microarray-based analysis is a great challenge because, for many bioassays, the amount of genetic material available for analysis is extremely limited. Currently, imaging and detection of DNA microarrays are based primarily on the use of organic dyes. To overcome the problems of photobleaching and low signal intensities of organic dyes, we developed a new class of silica core-shell nanoparticles that encapsulated with cyanine dyes and applied the dye-doped nanoparticles as labeling in the DNA microarray-based bioanalysis. The developed nanoparticles have core-shell structure containing 15-nm Au colloidal cores with 95 dye-alkanethiol (dT)20 oligomers chemisorbed on the each Au particle surface and 10-15-nm silica coatings bearing thiol functional groups. To be utilized for microarray detection, the dye-doped nanoparticles were conjugated with DNA signaling probes by using heterobifunctional cross-linker. The prepared nanoparticle conjugates are stable in both aqueous electrolytes and organic solvents. Two-color DNA microarray-based detection was demonstrated in this work by using Cy3- and Cy5-doped nanoparticles in sandwich hybridization. The use of the fluorophore-doped nanoparticles in high-throughput microarray detection reveals higher sensitivity with a detection limit of 1 pM for target DNA in sandwich hybridization and greater photostable signals than the direct use of organic fluorophore as labeling. A wide dynamic range of approximately 4 orders of magnitude was also found when the dye-doped nanoparticles were applied in microarray-based DNA bioanalysis. In addition, the use of these dye-doped nanoparticles as the labeling in hybridization also improved the differentiation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. This work offers promising prospects for applying dye-doped nanoparticles as labeling for gene profiling based on DNA microarray technology.",,,"Base Pairing, Coated Materials, Biocompatible, Colloids, Coloring Agents, DNA, Gold, Light, Nanostructures, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sensitivity and Specificity, Silicon Dioxide",,
15283599,Detection of oligosaccharides labeled with cyanine dyes using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.,"The sensitivity of oligosaccharides in mass spectrometry lags far behind that of peptides. This is a critical factor in realizing the high-throughput analysis of posttranslational modifications in proteomics. We here described that hydrazide derivatives of cyanine dyes (Cy3, Cy5) with a positive charge made excellent labeling reagents for the detection of oligosaccharides by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Cy3-labeled standard N-glycan could be detected at 200 amol on the MALDI target plate in reflectron mode without any purification procedures after the labeling reaction, which may meet the level of sensitivity required in proteome research. Despite the general recognition that the production of signals of oligosaccharides under MALDI conditions would be highly dependent on the matrix, most of the known N-glycans from chicken ovalbumin could be detected upon Cye derivatization nearly independent of the kind of matrix tested (e.g., nor-harman, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid and alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid) without spoiling the signal strength. Postsource decay afforded simple spectra mainly consisting of Y-type fragment ions, thus simplifying the sequence analysis. In-source decay afforded a similar fragmentation pattern only when acidic matrixes were used. In addition, this derivatization technique was successfully applied to the profiling of N-glycans of gel-separated glycoproteins.",,,"Carbocyanines, Carbohydrate Sequence, Glycoproteins, Molecular Sequence Data, Oligosaccharides, Polysaccharides, Proteomics, Sensitivity and Specificity, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",,

The threshold voltage of the release changes depending on the kind of linker added to the DNA 3'-terminal. The amount of released DNA depends on the duration of the voltage pulse.

The subsequent reaction of the 2-cyano-styryl benzooxazoles with 2(4)-methyl substituted heterocyclic quaternary salts afforded meso-substituted styryl-2(4)-polymethine cyanines.

Here we assess a common method to analyze DIGE data using the DeCyder software system. Experimental error was studied by a series of same sample comparisons. Aliquots of sample were labeled with N-hydroxyl succinimidyl ester-derivatives of Cy2, Cy3, and Cy5 dyes and run together on one gel. This allowed assessment of how experimental error influenced differential expression analysis. Bias in the log volume ratios was observed, which could be explained by differences in dye background. Further complications are caused by significant gel-to-gel variation in the spot volume ratio distributions. Using DeCyder alone results in an inability to define ratio thresholds for 90 or 95% confidence. An alternative normalization method was thus applied which resulted in improved data distribution and allowed greater sensitivity in analysis. When combined with a standardizing function, this allowed gel-independent thresholds for 90% confidence. The new approach, detailed here, represents a method to greatly improve the success of DIGE data analysis.",,,"Bacterial Proteins, Bias, Carbocyanines, Confidence Intervals, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Erwinia, Fluorescent Dyes, Proteins, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity, Software, Staining and Labeling",,

A new facile synthetic route to this type of cyanine dyes has been developed, involving the preparation of 6-substituted 2-thiomethyl-benzothiazoles in good yields. The new dyes are analogues to the minor groove binding unsymmetrical cyanine dye, BEBO, recently reported by us. In this dye, the structure of the known intercalating cyanine dye BO was extended with a 6-methylbenzothiazole substituent. Herein we further investigate the role of the extending benzazole heterocycle, as well as of the pyridine or quinoline moiety of the cyanine chromophore, for the binding mode of these crescent-shaped dyes to calf thymus DNA. Flow LD and CD studies of the 12 dyes show that the extent of minor groove binding to mixed sequence DNA varies significantly between the dyes. We find that hydrophobicity and size are the crucial parameters for recognition of the minor groove. The relatively high fluorescence quantum yield of many of these cyanines bound to DNA, combined with their absorption at long wavelengths, may render them useful in biological applications. In particular, two of the benzoxazole containing dyes BOXTO and 2-BOXTO show a high degree of minor groove binding and quantum yields of 0.52 and 0.32, respectively, when bound to DNA.",,,"Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Circular Dichroism, DNA, Spectrum Analysis",,

The development of highly sensitive light detection systems has allowed biologists to use imaging in studying physiological processes. Over the last few decades, biochemists have also worked to isolate and further develop optical reporters such as GFP, luciferase, and cyanine dyes.

14708031,Protein profiling of human postmortem brain using 2-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE).,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-D GE) is a key tool for comparative proteomics research. With its ability to separate complex protein mixtures with high resolution, 2-D GE is a technique commonly employed for protein profiling studies. Significant improvements have been made in 2-D GE technology with the development of two-dimensional fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE), where proteins are first labelled with one of three spectrally resolvable fluorescent cyanine dyes before being separated over first and second dimensions according to their charge and size, respectively. When used in conjunction with automated analysis packages, this multiplexing approach can accurately and reproducibly quantify protein expression for control and experimental groups. Differentially expressed proteins can be subsequently identified by mass spectrometric methods. Here, we describe the successful application and optimisation of 2-D DIGE technology for human postmortem brain studies. This technology, especially when coupled with other functional genomics approaches, such as transcriptomics and metabolomics studies, will enhance our current understanding of human disease and lead to new therapeutic and diagnostic possibilities.",,,"Brain Chemistry, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Proteomics, Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",,
14632079,Effects of atmospheric ozone on microarray data quality.,"A data anomaly was observed that affected the uniformity and reproducibility of fluorescent signal across DNA microarrays. Results from experimental sets designed to identify potential causes (from microarray production to array scanning) indicated that the anomaly was linked to a batch process; further work allowed us to localize the effect to the posthybridization array stringency washes. Ozone levels were monitored and highly correlated with the batch effect. Controlled exposures of microarrays to ozone confirmed this factor as the root cause, and we present data that show susceptibility of a class of cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy5, Alexa 647) to ozone levels as low as 5-10 ppb for periods as short as 10-30 s. Other cyanine dyes (e.g., Cy3, Alexa 555) were not significantly affected until higher ozone levels (> 100 ppb). To address this environmental effect, laboratory ozone levels should be kept below 2 ppb (e.g., with filters in HVAC) to achieve high quality microarray data.",,,"Artifacts, Atmosphere, Carbocyanines, Desiccation, Fluorescence, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Ozone, Quality Control, Reproducibility of Results",,
14602365,Quinoline and cyanine dyes--putative anti-MRSA drugs.,"One way in which drug-resistant bacteria may be attacked is to screen new series of candidate compounds. Quaternary quinoline compounds and dyes were studied by Carl Browning (1887-1972) and Julius Cohen (1859-1935). A remarkable part of Browning and Cohen's work was the early development of structure-activity relationships for their series of compounds. Thus cationic species were found generally to be more effective antibacterials than neutrals or anionics, and the testing of partial or deconstructed active molecules was also carried out. Much of this work underpinned the fuller understanding of e.g. aminoacridine action developed by Adrien Albert (1907-1989), himself also a collaborator of Browning. Analysis of the activity of a range of compounds developed by Browning and Cohen suggests that these might again be examined as topical antimicrobials in the fight against methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and other resistant bacteria.",,,"Anti-Bacterial Agents, Carbocyanines, Humans, Methicillin Resistance, Quinolines, Staphylococcus aureus, Structure-Activity Relationship",,
14576311,Groove-binding unsymmetrical cyanine dyes for staining of DNA: dissociation rates in free solution and electrophoresis gels.,"The rates of dissociation of three non-intercalative unsymmetrical cyanine dyes, BEBO, BETO and BOXTO from mixed-sequence DNA have been studied with the DNA either free in solution or in confining porous agarose gels. The properties of the new dyes were compared to the related intercalating dyes BO, BO-PRO, TO-PRO and YO-PRO. With DNA in solution, BEBO dissociates more slowly than the monovalent BO and interestingly also more slowly than the divalent dye BO-PRO. Similarly, both BETO and BOXTO exhibit considerably slower dissociation than TO-PRO. The new dyes show biexponential dissociation kinetics in mixed-sequence DNA. The average rate of dissociation increases with increasing ionic strength, but the salt dependence of the dissociation is weaker than for the corresponding intercalating dye. The rate of dye-dissociation decreases by a factor of about 10(5) in the gel. The rates for the dyes generally follow the pattern that we observe with the DNA in free solution, however a more accentuated stabilization was seen for intercalators than for groove-bound dyes. The results show that, in particular, BOXTO is a promising candidate as a preferentially groove-bound DNA-stain with a large enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield upon binding to DNA, and which exhibits slow and salt-insensitive dissociation compared to corresponding intercalative dyes.",,,"Animals, Benzothiazoles, Carbocyanines, Cattle, DNA, Electrophoresis, Agar Gel, Fluorescent Dyes, Intercalating Agents, Kinetics, Molecular Structure, Pyridinium Compounds, Quinolinium Compounds, Sodium Chloride, Solutions, Thiazoles",,
14576310,Groove-binding unsymmetrical cyanine dyes for staining of DNA: syntheses and characterization of the DNA-binding.,"Two new crescent-shaped unsymmetrical cyanine dyes have been synthesised and their interactions with DNA have been investigated by different spectroscopic methods. These dyes are analogues to a minor groove binding unsymmetrical cyanine dye, BEBO, recently reported by us. In this dye, the structure of the known intercalating cyanine dye BO was extended with a benzothiazole substituent. To investigate how the identity of the extending heterocycle affects the binding to DNA, the new dyes BETO and BOXTO have a benzothiazole group and a benzoxazole moiety, respectively. Whereas BEBO showed a heterogeneous binding to calf thymus DNA, linear and circular dichroism studies of BOXTO indicate a high preference for minor groove binding. BETO also binds in the minor groove to mixed sequence DNA but has a contribution of non-ordered and non-emissive species present. A non-intercalative binding mode of the new dyes, as well as for BEBO, is further supported by electrophoresis unwinding assays. These dyes, having comparable spectral properties as the intercalating cyanine dyes, but bind in the minor groove instead, might be useful complements for staining of DNA. In particular, the benzoxazole substituted dye BOXTO has attractive fluorescence properties with a quantum yield of 0.52 when bound to mixed sequence DNA and a 300-fold increase in fluorescence intensity upon binding.",,,"Animals, Benzothiazoles, Carbocyanines, Cattle, Circular Dichroism, DNA, DNA, Superhelical, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Structure, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Quinolinium Compounds, Staining and Labeling, Thiazoles",,
14572036,"An identification method for altered proteins in tissues utilizing fluorescence derivatization, liquid chromatography, tandem mass spectrometry, and a database-searching algorithm.","Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) is now widely used as a tool for proteomic studies. For the sensitive determination of proteins in 2D-PAGE, fluorescence derivatization of primary amino moieties of proteins with cyanine dyes was recently developed. However, precipitation of the proteins could occur if completely derivatized because of the lower solubility of the resultant derivatives owing to the hydrophobicity of the reagents and the loss of the hydrophilic primary amino moieties. Thus, in this paper, a water-soluble and thiol-specific fluorogenic reagent, ammonium 7-fluoro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole-4-sulfonate, was adopted for the derivatization of proteins in tissues either with and without stimulation. Then, the method follows a separation of the derivatives by liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection, an isolation of only the altered proteins, an enzymatic digestion of the isolated proteins, and an identification of the proteins by liquid chromatography/MS/MS with the database-searching algorithm. By using this method, we identified the altered expressions of five increased proteins (e.g., pancreatic polypeptide) as well as three decreased proteins (e.g., insulin 2) in the islets of Langerhans in Wistar rats 2 days after they were subcutaneously administered with dexamethasone.",,,"Algorithms, Animals, Cattle, Cell Culture Techniques, Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid, Databases, Protein, Dexamethasone, Fluorescence, Gene Expression Regulation, Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions, Islets of Langerhans, Mass Spectrometry, Peptides, Proteins, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Serum Albumin, Bovine, Solubility",,
14532180,Molecular detection and identification of influenza viruses by oligonucleotide microarray hybridization.,"Microarrays of virus-specific oligonucleotides may provide a method of screening samples for the presence or absence of a large variety of viruses simultaneously. Influenza viruses are ideal for evaluating such microarrays because of their genetic and host diversity, and the availability of an extensive sequence database. A collection of 476 influenza virus-specific oligonucleotides was spotted onto glass slides as probes. Viral RNAs were reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR, and the products were labeled with cyanine dyes. The presence of viruses and their identities were determined by hybridization. The fluorescence intensities of oligonucleotide spots were highly reproducible within each slide and satisfactorily proportional between experiments. However, the intensities of probe spots completely complementary to target sequences varied from background to saturation. The variations did not correlate with base composition, nucleotide sequence, or internal secondary structures. Therefore, thresholds for determining whether hybridization to a spot should be judged as positive were assigned individually. Considering only positive spots from probes predicted to be monospecific for influenza virus species, subtype, host source, or gene segment, this method made correct identifications at the species, hemagglutinin subtype, and gene segment levels. Monospecific neuraminidase (NA) subtype probes were insufficiently diverse to allow confident NA subtype assignment. Incorporating positive spots from polyspecific probes into the identification scheme gave similar results. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential of microarray-based oligonucleotide hybridization for multiple virus detection.",,,"Animals, DNA, Complementary, Hemagglutinin Glycoproteins, Influenza Virus, Humans, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Oligonucleotide Probes, Orthomyxoviridae, Reproducibility of Results",,
14501076,Expression profiling using cDNA microarrays.,"Microarray technology has become increasingly useful in measuring expression levels of a large number of genes and part of a repertoire of functional genomic tools. We describe the methods of cDNA microarray preparation, the use, data collection, and initial data processing. The cDNA fragments are first prepared by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and then attached to a solid substrate, such as a chemically treated glass slide. Robotic machines spot the prepared cloned cDNA samples in a miniaturized gridded pattern, so that nanoliter amounts of tens of thousands cDNA samples are bound to a single 7.5 x 2.5 cm glass slide. Probes are generated from RNA samples of test and control tissues by incorporating Cyanine dyes (Cy3 or Cy5) in reverse-transcribed products. Probes from a test sample are labeled with one of two Cy dyes and mixed in equal amounts with probes from a control sample labeled with the second dye. The glass slides containing the cDNA microarray are hybridized with the mixed Cy-labeled probes, washed, dried, and scanned using laser scanners with an optimized wavelength to excite each Cy dye. The emission image patterns for each dye are captured by a digital camera using micro-optics and processed into numerical values that positively correlate with quantitative levels of mRNA for each cDNA spot on the slide. The collected data is then further processed, normalized across experiments, and examined via numerous statistical and mathematical approaches to infer changes in expression levels of particular genes due to the treatment tested.",,,"DNA, Complementary, Expressed Sequence Tags, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Library, Indicators and Reagents, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Plants, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Software",,
13129393,A fluorescence resonance energy transfer sensor based on maltose binding protein.,"A fluorescence resonance energy-transfer (FRET) sensing system for maltose based on E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is demonstrated. The FRET donor portion of the sensing system consists of MBP modified with long wavelength-excitable cyanine dyes (Cy3 or Cy3.5). The novel acceptor portion of the sensor consists of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) modified with either the cyanine dye Cy5 or the dark quencher QSY9. Binding of the modified beta-CD to dye-conjugated MBP results in assembly of the FRET complex. Added maltose displaces the beta-CD-dye adduct and disrupts the FRET complex, resulting in a direct change in fluorescence of the donor moiety. In the use of these FRET pairs, MBP dissociation values for maltose were estimated (0.14-2.90 microM). Maltose limits of detection were in the 50-100 nm range.",,,"Biosensing Techniques, Carrier Proteins, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, Maltose-Binding Proteins",,

Because J-aggregates of cyanine dye exhibit sharp absorption bands (i.e., J-band), they are important sensitizers. In this article, the J-aggregation behavior of two kinds of anionic-cationic cyanine dyes adsorbed on the AgBrI cubic microcrystals was studied. The reflectance spectral curves of J-aggregating dyes were measured by UV-Vis. spectrophotometer, and were compared with the J-aggregation of anionic and cationic cyanine dyes. The results show that the reflectance spectra of J-aggregates of anionic-cationic cyanine dyes adsorbed on AgBrI microcrystals have peak wavelengths of anionic and cationic cyanine dyes. Anionic-cationic cyanine dyes have two sensitivity regions, including both the sensitivity region of anionic cyanine dye and the sensitivity region of cationic cyanine dye.",,,,,

12778007,Differential protein analysis of spasomolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia using laser capture microdissection and two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.,"Full analysis of cellular protein constituents is a valuable tool in the evaluation of tissues. Traditional methods of evaluation, however, are time-consuming and difficult to reproduce. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE), a recently developed proteomic system, affords the ability to compare and evaluate protein extracts from multiple sources. Coupled with laser capture microdissection (LCM), this technology is a powerful tool in comparing the protein profiles of separate pure cell populations. Proteins are labeled in vitro with reactive cyanine dyes that fluoresce at differential wavelengths, and after comigration on two-dimensional gels, differing protein populations become apparent. The unique aspect of this technology is the ability to identify and quantify proteins from separate preparations without issues of gel-to-gel differences. These techniques coupled with the systems for robotic acquisition of specific spots on the gel, tryptic digestion, and MALDI mass spectrometry permit identification of proteins differentially expressed in two pure cell populations. The authors used these new technologies to analyze the protein constituents of spasmolytic polypeptide expressing metaplasia (SPEM), a gastric mucosal metaplasia (fundic antralization or pseudopyloric metaplasia) that develops in the atrophic fundus mucosa of mice infected with Helicobacter felis and in humans infected with Helicobacter pylori. In addition, SPEM has been identified in the atrophic mucosa surrounding a high percentage of gastric adenocarcinomas and may represent a precursor lineage of malignancy. This technology recognized 28 differentially expressed proteins between SPEM and surface cells. Identification of novel SPEM-related proteins would allow the development of new immunohistochemical antibodies to further study this important metaplasia.",,,"Animals, Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional, Gastric Fundus, Gastric Mucosa, Helicobacter Infections, Helicobacter felis, Immunohistochemistry, Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins, Lasers, Metaplasia, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Microdissection, Peptides, Proteins, Proteomics, Reproducibility of Results",,
12726994,Spectroscopic studies of the interaction of bichromophoric cyanine dyes with DNA. Effect of ionic strength.,"Spectroscopic characteristics of a cyanine dye with two chromophores (biscyanine dye, BCD) in aqueous solutions and effects of NaCl and DNA upon these characteristics have been studied by optical absorption, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopies. In homogeneous solutions, BCD is characterized by intense optical absorption (epsilon =1.33 x 10(5) M(-1) x cm(-1)) and weak fluorescence (phi(fl)=0.018) in the wavelength region greater than 600 nm. The dye forms H-aggregates at low concentrations (10(-6) M). NaCl stimulates the formation of both H- and J-aggregates of the dye at much lower dye concentrations, while DNA in low concentrations (<10(-6) M) stimulated the formation of just J-aggregates on the surface of the DNA molecule. Higher DNA concentrations induce the dye to disaggregate, and there exists an equilibrium between three dye forms: free monomers, J-aggregates and bound monomers, the maximum content of J-aggregates was observed at [DNA]/[BCD]=0.6+/-0.2 and total disaggregation at [DNA]/[BCD]=190+/-20. J-aggregates are characterized by phi(fl)=0.05 and bound monomers by phi(fl)=0.44. In the presence of NaCl, total disaggregation was observed at [DNA]/[BCD]=570+/-10 due to competition between Na(+) and the dye molecules for DNA electronegative binding sites.",,,"Carbocyanines, Chromogenic Compounds, Circular Dichroism, DNA, Osmolar Concentration, Photochemotherapy, Sodium Chloride, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,
12659519,Photophysics and photochemistry of hydrophilic cyanine dyes in normal and reverse micelles.,"The photophysical and photochemical properties of the negatively charged hydrophilic cyanine dyes 1-3 were studied in isooctane/sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT)/water and cyclohexane-hexanol/Triton X-100 (TX100)/water reverse micelles and in aqueous solutions in the presence of surfactants. In spite of the opposite total charges, 2 and its structural analog, cationic 3,3'-diethylthiacarbocyanine (DTC), show similar photophysical and photochemical behaviour in AOT reverse micelles. However, in normal micelles their photophysical properties are quite different: 2 exhibits unusual behaviour [a sharp increase in the fluorescence quantum yield (phif) in the presence of both cationic and anionic micelles, but very small changes with neutral TX100], whereas the behaviour of DTC is normal. The phif values of 1-3 in AOT reverse micelles suffer a steep drop when w0 increases from 0 to 10 (w0 = [H2O]/[AOT]) and remain essentially constant at higher w0, while in TX100 reverse micelles the phif values undergo small variations with w0. A decrease in the photoisomerization quantum yield, and a rise in phif in S1 --> T intersystem crossing, in the back isomerization activation energy and in the preexponential factor were found for 1-3 in AOT reverse micelles with small w0. The unusual behaviour of 1-3 in micelles is attributed to the bipolar structure of the dyes.",,,,,
12614890,Synthesis and DNA binding studies of a new asymmetric cyanine dye binding in the minor groove of [poly(dA-dT)]2.,"A new asymmetric cyanine dye has been synthesised and its interaction with different DNA has been investigated. In this dye, BEBO, the structure of the known intercalating cyanine dye BO has been extended with a benzothiazole substituent. The resulting crescent-shape of the molecule is similar to that of the well-known minor groove binder Hoechst 33258. Indeed, comparative studies of BO illustrate a considerable change in binding mode induced by this structural modification. Linear and circular dichroism studies indicate that BEBO binds in the minor groove to [poly (dA-dT)](2), but that the binding to calf thymus DNA is heterogeneous, although still with a significant contribution of minor groove binding. Similar to other DNA binding asymmetric cyanine dyes, BEBO has a large increase in fluorescence intensity upon binding and a relatively large quantum yield when bound. The minor groove binding of BEBO to [poly (dA-dT)](2) affords roughly a 180-fold increase in intensity, which is larger than to that of the commonly used minor groove binding probes DAPI and Hoechst 33258.",,,"Animals, Bisbenzimidazole, Carbocyanines, Cattle, Circular Dichroism, Coloring Agents, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Indicators and Reagents, Indoles, Poly dA-dT, Polynucleotides",,
12582258,Directly labeled mRNA produces highly precise and unbiased differential gene expression data.,"Microarray based gene expression studies allow simultaneous analysis of relative amounts of messenger RNA (mRNA) for thousands of genes using fluorescently labeled nucleic acid targets. Most common methods use enzymatic techniques, such as oligo-dT primed reverse transcription to produce labeled cDNA. These labeling methods have a number of shortcomings, including enzyme- introduced labeling and sequence bias, laborious protocols, high experiment-to-experiment variability and an inability to detect small changes in expression levels. Here, we describe a novel labeling methodology that uses platinum-linked cyanine dyes to directly chemically label mRNA from as little as 2 micro g of total RNA. We show that the gene expression data produced using the labeled mRNA method has very high precision, low error, no labeling bias and a dynamic range over several orders of magnitude. This allows a greater accuracy in the identification of differentially expressed genes and cuts down on the need for running too many replicate assays. Small changes in gene expression can now be detected in large-scale gene expression profiling assays using this simple, easy and quick procedure.",,,"Carbocyanines, DNA, Complementary, Fluorescent Dyes, Gene Expression Profiling, HL-60 Cells, Humans, Jurkat Cells, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, RNA, Messenger, Reproducibility of Results, Sensitivity and Specificity",,

All donor and acceptor molecules used were cyanine dyes. Investigation was performed at the ensemble level as well as at the single-molecule level. The ensemble measurements revealed a distribution of binding sites as well for the donor as for the acceptor. Accordingly, we found a distribution of the energy transfer efficiency. At the single-molecule level, these distributions are still present. We could discriminate entities that show very efficient energy transfer, some that do not show any energy transfer and systems whose energy transfer efficiency is only about 50%. The latter allowed the time-resolved detection of energy transfer of single entities through the acceptor decay. Finally, we discuss the observation that the energy transfer efficiency fluctuates as a function of time.",,,,,
12511106,Interaction of cyanine dyes with nucleic acids: XXVI. Intercalation of the trimethine cyanine dye cyan 2 into double-stranded DNA: study by spectral luminescence methods.,"The interaction between double-stranded (ds) DNA and the cyanine dye Cyan 2 has been studied with spectral luminescence methods. Binding constant values have been determined by fluorescence titration and dye distribution in the two-phase system ethyl acetate-water (3.6 x 10(4) and 1.5 x 10(4) M(-1), respectively). Cyan 2 exhibits a small specificity for guanine-cytosine (GC) sequences in total DNA and synthetic polydeoxynucleotides poly(dA/dT) and poly(dGdC/dGdC). The DNA complexes with Cyan 2 are stable at high-ionic strength solution when NaCl is added. The dye molecule complexed with DNA is apparently shielded from the anionic quencher--iodide ion. The negative linear dichroism of the visible absorption band of aligned Cyan 2-DNA complexes indicates that the bound dye lies almost perpendicularly to the DNA helix axis. The linear dichroism of the absorption band at 260 nm suggests a considerable change in the DNA B-form.

Gene probes were amplified by PCR from a plasmid bank of characterised E. coli virulence genes and were spotted onto a glass slide to form an array of capture probes. Genomic DNA from E. coli strains which were to be tested for the presence of these virulence gene sequences was labelled with fluorescent cyanine dyes by random amplification and then hybridised against the array of probes. The hybridisation, washing and data analysis conditions were optimised for glass slides, and the applicability of the method for identifying the presence of the virulence genes was determined using reference strains and clinical isolates. It was found to be a sensitive screening method for detecting virulence genes, and a powerful tool for determining the pathotype of E. coli.

12469338,Fluorescence two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry based proteomic analysis of Escherichia coli.,"Separation and relative quantitation of complex protein mixtures remain two of the most challenging aspects of proteomics. Here an advanced technique called fluorescence difference 2-D gel electrophoresis technology (2D-DIGE) has been applied to a model system study of the Escherichia coli proteome after benzoic acid treatment. The molecular weight and charge matched cyanine dyes enable pre-electrophoretic labelling of control and treated samples which are then mixed and run in the same gel. Pooled control and treated samples labelled with Cy trade mark 3 were used as an internal standard for both Cy5 labelled control and treated E. coli samples. Together with DeCyder trade mark imaging analysis software, more accurate quantitative analysis than conventional two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was achieved. Using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight and quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry a total of 179 differentially expressed protein spots were identified. These included enzymes, stress related and substrate (e.g. amino acids, maltose, ribose and TRP repressor) binding proteins. Of the spots analysed, 77% contained only one protein species per spot, hence the change in protein expression measured was solely attributed to the identified protein. Many membrane proteins and protein isoforms were identified indicating both adequate solubilization of E. coli samples and potential post-translational modification.

12225587,A new non-linear normalization method for reducing variability in DNA microarray experiments.,"Microarray data are subject to multiple sources of variation, of which biological sources are of interest whereas most others are only confounding. Recent work has identified systematic sources of variation that are intensity-dependent and non-linear in nature. Systematic sources of variation are not limited to the differing properties of the cyanine dyes Cy(5) and Cy(3) as observed in cDNA arrays, but are the general case for both oligonucleotide microarray (Affymetrix GeneChips) and cDNA microarray data. Current normalization techniques are most often linear and therefore not capable of fully correcting for these effects. We present here a simple and robust non-linear method for normalization using array signal distribution analysis and cubic splines. These methods compared favorably to normalization using robust local-linear regression (lowess). The application of these methods to oligonucleotide arrays reduced the relative error between replicates by 5-10% compared with a standard global normalization method. Application to cDNA arrays showed improvements over the standard method and over Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization based on dye-swap replication. In addition, a set of known differentially regulated genes was ranked higher by the t-test. In either cDNA or Affymetrix technology, signal-dependent bias was more than ten times greater than the observed print-tip or spatial effects. Intensity-dependent normalization is important for both high-density oligonucleotide array and cDNA array data. Both the regression and spline-based methods described here performed better than existing linear methods when assessed on the variability of replicate arrays. Dye-swap normalization was less effective at Cy(3)-Cy(5) normalization than either regression or spline-based methods alone.",,,"Cell Line, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, RNA, Reference Standards, Reproducibility of Results, Statistics as Topic",,

12144356,Long range molecular wire behaviour in a metal complex of DNA.,"M-DNA is a complex of metal ions such as Zn(2+) with duplex DNA. Previous results showed that the fluorescence of a donor fluorophore was quenched when an acceptor fluorophore was placed at the opposite end of a short M-DNA duplex. In order to investigate further the molecular wire behaviour of M-DNA, 30-mer duplexes were constructed with fluorescein as donor and rhodamine, pyrene and the cyanine dyes, Cy5 and Cy5.5 as acceptors. Good quenching was observed in all cases even though the efficiency of resonance energy transfer was calculated to be < 5%. The distance dependence of quenching was investigated by preparing doubly-labelled duplexes ranging in length from 20 to 1,000 base pairs. Upon formation of M-DNA significant quenching of the fluorescence of the donor fluorophore was observed in duplexes up to 500 base pairs in length. The amount of quenching decreased with increasing length of the duplexes with a shallow distance dependence. The results are consistent with an electron transfer mechanism in which the electron hops between metal centers. This process can occur efficiently over long distances.",,,"Base Sequence, DNA, Models, Chemical, Molecular Sequence Data, Nucleic Acid Conformation, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Zinc",,

However, the published syntheses of cysteine-selective derivatives produce relatively low yields from expensive starting materials, or produce molecules with marginal water solubility for protein labeling. We report here facile syntheses (four steps, >50% overall yield) of iodoacetamide, sulfhydryl-reactive derivatives of the Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores.

11990999,"Analysis of dimeric cyanine-nucleic acid dyes by capillary zone electrophoresis in N,N-dimethylacetamide as non-aqueous organic solvent.","A method based on capillary zone electrophoresis is presented for the determination of the purity of commercial dimeric cyanine dyes (TOTO, YOYO, BOBO, all -1 and -3 species, LOLO-1, POPO-1) that are common as fluorescent probes for nucleic acid staining. These dyes are tetracharged cations, and have a strong tendency to interact with negatively charged centres, where they are rapidly adsorbed, especially from aqueous solutions. Thus anionic sites at the capillary wall must be avoided, and aqueous buffers are not suitable. The method introduced here avoids both complications, using non-aqueous N,N-dimethylacetamide as solvent, and suppressing the dissociation of silanol groups at the capillary surface due to selection of acidic separation conditions (20 mmol/l perchloric acid as background electrolyte). The present method enables the determination of the purity of all 10 dyes in less than 15 min. The selectivity of the method allows separation of at least five main and differentiating a number of unresolved minor contaminants as demonstrated in detail for TOTO-3 as an example. Quantitation (with 100% normalisation of the peak areas) of nine lots of this dye results in a purity between 33 and 87%.",,,"Acetamides, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Dimerization, Electrophoresis, Capillary, Nucleic Acids, Photochemistry",,

During this period, important families of cyanine dyes were developed for sensitive detection of double-stranded DNA, single-stranded DNA, and oligo(deoxy)nucleotides in gels and in solution, and families of energy transfer primers were produced for DNA sequencing applications. The continuing quest for improved labels for hybridization assays has produced a series of candidate labels including genes encoding enzymes, microparticles (e.g. quantum dots, nanocrystals, phosphors), and new examples of the fluorophore (e.g. cyanine dyes) and enzyme class of labels (e.g. firefly luciferase mutants). Label detection technologies for use in northern and southern blotting assays have focused on luminescent methods, particularly enhanced chemiluminescence for peroxidase labels and adamantyl 1,2-dioxetanes for alkaline phosphatase labels. Sets of labels have been selected to meet the demands of multicolour assays (e.g. four-colour sequencing and single nucleotide primer extension assays). Non-separation assay formats have emerged based on fluorescence polarization, fluorescence energy transfer (TaqMan, molecular beacons) and channelling principles. Microanalytical devices (microchips), high-throughput simultaneous test arrays (microarrays, gene chips), capillary electrophoretic analysis and dipstick devices have presented new challenges and requirements for nucleic acid detection, and fluorescent methods currently dominate in many of these applications.",,,"Alkaline Phosphatase, Coloring Agents, Fluorescent Dyes, Humans, Luminescent Measurements, Nucleic Acid Hybridization, Nucleic Acids, Peroxidase, Radioisotopes, Staining and Labeling",,

While in water solution of 'free' dye Cyan betaiPr stays mainly in monomeric form, in the presence of DNA the dye molecules form J-aggregates. The molecular structure of these J-aggregates causes the Davydov splitting of their absorption band, corresponding to the first electronic transition. A study of site-specificity showed that in the presence of poly (dA/dT) the majority of Cyan betaiPr molecules form J-aggregates, while in the presence of poly (dGC/dGC) dye molecules stay mainly in monomeric form and in presence of chicken erythrocytes DNA both J-aggregate and monomeric forms of dye are present. We suppose that Cyan betaiPr molecules aggregate in DNA groove, which serves as a template for J-aggregate forming. An increase of ionic strength of solution leads to the release of dye molecules from DNA grooves and prevents J-aggregates formation.",,,"Absorption, Carbocyanines, DNA, Fluorescence, Fluorescent Dyes, Molecular Structure, Sodium Chloride, Solutions, Spectrometry, Fluorescence",,

Excitation energies and oscillator and rotatory strengths were calculated for the five lowest energy singlet states. Both the long wavelength methine band and the cis-band could be identified unambiguously from their configurational parentage. The calculated state energies are within 0.09 eV of the experimental value for the methine band and within 0.16 eV for the cis-band. The calculated rotatory strengths of the methine band shows sign inversion as the length of the chromophore increases: negative for the short monomethine, strongly positive for the pentamethine. The trimethine presents a borderline case: the measured rotatory strength is almost nil, the calculated one depends on the geometry.

11567525,A new type of phosphorescent nanospheres for use in advanced time-resolved multiplexed bioassays.,"A new concept to design phosphorescent nanospheres is presented. The spheres are distinguishable by their individual decay time and spectral distribution of their emission spectra. They are composed of a phosphorescent ruthenium metal-ligand complex (MLC) dissolved, along with certain strongly fluorescent cyanine dyes, in modified polyacrylonitrile-based nanospheres. Since the emission spectrum of the MLC overlaps the absorption spectrum of the cyanine and both the MLC (the donor) and the cyanine (the acceptor) are in close spatial proximity, efficient resonance energy transfer (RET) does occur. Thus, the nanospheres emit dual luminescence, one from the acceptor dye and the other from the donor MLC. Variation of the concentrations of the acceptor dye results in a varying efficiency of RET, thus making the spheres distinguishable. Hence, a set of multiplexable sphere labels is obtained by using one MLC (acting as the phosphorescent donor and present in constant concentration) and one acceptor dye (which varies in terms of both spectral properties and concentration). The nanospheres can be identified by the emission maximum (reflecting the kind of acceptor dye) and by decay time (reflecting its concentration). Since the same donor MLC is used throughout, all nanospheres can be excited with the same light source.",,,"Biological Assay, Carbocyanines, Coloring Agents, Energy Transfer, Ligands, Luminescent Measurements, Microspheres, Ruthenium, Spectrum Analysis, Time Factors",,

Thermodynamics of the Hin recombinase and Tc3 transposase DNA-binding domains with and without the conjugated dyes were studied by fluorescence techniques to determine the contributions to specific and nonspecific binding in terms of the polyelectrolyte and hydrophobic effects. The roles of the electrostatic interactions in binding to the cognate and noncognate sequences indicate that nonspecific binding is more sensitive to changes in salt concentration, whereas the change in the heat capacity shows a greater sensitivity to temperature for the sequence-specific complexes in each case. The conjugated dyes affect the Hin DNA-binding domain by acting to anchor a short stretch of amino acids at the N-terminal end into the minor groove. In contrast, the N-terminal end of the Tc3 DNA-binding domain is bound in a well-ordered fashion to the DNA even in the absence of the conjugated dye.

For the free dyes, the nature of the reactive species involved in the photodegradation process is different for the monomer and the dimer, as shown by scavenger studies. For DNA-bound dyes, photoinduced fading of the visible absorption band occurs by different pathways depending on the drug binding mode and can be attenuated by appropriate scavengers. However, none of these scavengers were found to have any significant effect on the photobleaching of dye fluorescence.

The dyes form aggregates with a 'sandwich'-like structure in water solution. At low dye to DNA concentrations ratios, Cyan 13 and TO monomers appear to interact with the DNA. On increasing the dye to DNA concentrations ratio, free dye molecules aggregate with the DNA-bound ones. The spectra of the free dye aggregates and the aggregates formed on the DNA, are characterized by an anomalously large (more than 100 nm) Stokes shift. This suggests, that the pi-electron systems of the aggregates undergo substantial changes in excited state, compared to those of the monomers. The formation of aggregates consisting of the free and DNA-bound dye molecules can be explained using the half-intercalation model of the interaction of the cyanine dye monomers with the DNA.",,,"Absorption, Benzothiazoles, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Quinolines, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Thiazoles",,

The work was initiated in search of a quantitative method to detect the ratio of single-to-double stranded DNA (ssDNA/dsDNA) in solution based on the photophysics of dye-DNA complexes; the result is a comprehensive study providing a vast amount of information for users of DNA strains. The dyes examined were the bisbenzimide or indole-derived stains (Hoechst 33342, Hoechst 33258 and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole), phenanthridinium stains (ethidium bromide and propidium iodide) and cyanine dyes (PicoGreen, YOYO-1 iodide, SYBR Green I and SYBR Gold). All were evaluated under the same experimental conditions in terms of ionic strength, pH and dye-DNA ratio. Among the photophysical properties evaluated only fluorescence lifetimes for the cyanine stilbene dyes allowed a convenient differentiation between ssDNA and dsDNA. The bisbenzimide dyes showed multiexponential decays when bound to either form of DNA, making lifetime-based analysis cumbersome with inherent errors. These dyes also presented biexponential decay when free in aqueous buffered solutions at different pH. A mechanism for their deactivation is proposed based on two different conformers decaying with different kinetics. The phenanthridinium dyes showed monoexponential decays with ssDNA and dsDNA, but there was no discrimination between them. High dye-DNA ratios (e.g. 1:1) resulted in multiexponential decays for cyanine dyes, resulting from energy transfer or self-quenching deactivation. Shifts in both absorption and fluorescence maxima for both ssDNA and dsDNA DNA-cyanine dye complexes were small. Broadening of dye-ssDNA absorption and fluorescence bands for the cyanine dyes relative to dye-dsDNA bands was detected and attributed to higher degrees of rotational freedom in the former.",,,"Circular Dichroism, DNA, DNA, Single-Stranded, Fluorescent Dyes, In Vitro Techniques, Photochemistry, Solutions, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Spectrophotometry, Water",,
11391571,Interaction of cyanine dyes with nucleic acids. XXI. Arguments for half-intercalation model of interaction.,"The spectral luminescent properties of two groups of monomethine cyanine dyes were studied in the presence of DNA. The first group included five dyes with 5,6-methylenedioxy-[d]-benzo-1,3-thiazole heterocycle and their unsubstituted analogs. Five monomethine pyrylium cyanines and their N-methyl-pyridine analogs were included in the second group. In each pair the pyrylium and pyridine dyes had similar geometry but differed in charge density distribution. The results presented some evidence in favor of the half-intercalation interaction mode between the studied dyes and DNA. When the benzothiazole residue had the lowest electron donor ability between the two heterocycles in the dye molecule, its substitution with the bulky methylenedioxy group led to a significant decrease in fluorescence enhancement of the dye-DNA complex. On the contrary, when the substituents that create steric hindrance (e.g., methylenedioxy and methyl groups) were introduced into the heterocycle with the higher electron donor ability, the fluorescence enhancement value of the dye-DNA complex was virtually unchanged. The changes in the Stock's shift values upon the formation of the dye-DNA complexes were in agreement with the proposed half-intercalation model. Interestingly, in the dye-DNA complexes the pyrylium dyes probably resided in a place similar to the pyridine ones. It is possible that the benzothiazole (or benzooxazole) ring intercalated between the DNA bases and the pyrylium (or pyridine) residue was located in the DNA groove closer to the phosphate backbone.",,,"Animals, Binding Sites, Carbocyanines, Chickens, Coloring Agents, Drug Interactions, Intercalating Agents, Nucleic Acids, Spectrometry, Fluorescence, Structure-Activity Relationship",,

The detection limit of dsDNA is about 1.7 ng/ml. Some of dyes studied are able to distinguish between dsDNA and ssDNA, RNA, BSA in solution and gel electrophoresis. The influence of different factors (temperature, pH and viscosity of the medium, presence of histone) on the formation of the dye-biopolymer complexes is investigated.

11185797,Photo-induced structural changes of azobenzene Langmuir-Blodgett films.,"Structural changes of the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films of azobenzene accompanied by photoisomerization are described. First, photoisomerization is explained in terms of 'free volume'. In the polyion complex monolayers of amphiphiles having two azobenzene units at the air-water interface, the area per molecule depends on the polycation species. The fraction of cis-azobenzene in the LB films at the photostationary state under the illumination with UV light increased with increasing area per molecule, which is consistent with the concept of free volume. Second, a counter example of the concept of free volume is presented. Three-dimensional cone-shaped structures developed with trans-to-cis photoisomerization in the polyion complex LB film of a water-soluble amphiphilic azobenzene. These structures appeared and disappeared reversibly by alternate illumination with UV and visible light. The results indicate that the two-dimensional LB film structure exerts significant modification by photoisomerization. This is against the concept of free volume because this concept does not consider the possibility that the two-dimensional LB film structures may change into three-dimensional ones. Finally, photo-induced J-aggregate formation of non-photochromic and photochromic dyes is described. Two cyanine dyes were each mixed with an amphiphilic azobenzene in the LB films. These cyanine dyes are known to form J-aggregates in single-component LB films. In the mixed LB films, the J-aggregate formation was suppressed to some extent. The alternate illumination of the films with UV and visible light caused the photoisomerization of azobenzene in the mixed LB films, which triggered the J-aggregate formation of the cyanine dyes. The J-aggregate formation was accompanied by the development of three-dimensional cone-shaped structures from the film surface. When an amphiphilic merocyanine was mixed with the azobenzene in the LB films, J-aggregate formation was also induced by the alternate illumination with UV and visible light. This J-aggregate formation was also accompanied by a large morphological change: circular domains changed into fractal-like ones. The J-aggregate formation of the dyes and the concomitant morphological change were irreversible. In these cases, the photoisomerization of azobenzene served as a trigger to induce self-organization of the dye molecules.",,,,,

The preparation was performed by automated solid-phase synthesis, with subsequent attachment of the cyanine dye and cleavage of the entire conjugate from the resin. The compounds display high molar absorbance and fluorescence quantum yields typical for cyanine dyes and are thus suitable receptor-targeted contrast agents for molecular optical imaging. The ability of these agents to target the somatostatin receptor was demonstrated by flow cytometry in vitro, in which the indotricarbocyanine conjugate led to elevated cell-associated fluorescence on somatostatin receptor-expressing tumor cells. In contrast, the corresponding linearized derivative of the sequence H(2)N-(D-Phe)-Met-Phe-(D-Trp)-Lys-Thr-Met-Thr-OH produced only minimal cell fluorescence, hence confirming the specificity of the cyclic somatostatin analogue.

In Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) clones expressing ET(B)/EGFP fusion proteins, single class high affinity binding sites for [125I]endothelin-1 (ET-1) were found (for two different clones apparent K(D) values were 31 +/- 15 pM and 30 +/- 7 pM). Pretreatment of membranes with GTPgammaS prior to saturation analysis did not alter these values. We also labelled ET-1 with cyanine-dyes (Cy3/ET-1, Cy5/ET-1). In displacement analyses with membranes of MDCK ET(B)/EGFP clones using [125I]ET-1, we found reduced affinity for Cy3/ET-1 and Cy5/ET-1 (about 5- to 10-fold, respectively), but normal efficacy when compared to unlabelled ET-1. Both fluorescent ligands and the ET(B)/EGFP fusion protein were suitable for analysis of receptor trafficking in living cells and cells fixed at different timepoints. Laser scanning microscopy of MDCK ET(B)/EGFP clones incubated with Cy3/ET-1 or Cy5/ET-1 revealed rapid internalization of ligand/receptor complexes, which clustered in large, perinuclear structures (most probably late endosomes).

The ligands were shown to form a monomer type complex into the DNA minor groove. The complex of quinoline-containing ligand with calf thymus DNA appeared to be the most resistant to ionic strength, and it did not dissociate completely even in 1 M NaCl. Binding of cyanine dyes to DNA could also be characterized by possibility to form ligand dimers into the DNA minor groove, by slight preference of binding to AT pairs, as well as by possible intercalation between base pairs of poly(dG)-poly(dC).

It was found that the dyes 5a and 5b interact with DNA, with quenching of the band intensies accompanied with a red shift of the absorption and emission bands. Moreover, irradiation of salts 5a and 5b in the presence of DNA results in DNA damage. Solution photolysis of acridizinium salt 5a gave the head-to-tail dimers as the major products (>95%), whereas the acridizinium salt 5b afforded the anti-head-to-tail dimer along with both head-to-head isomers.

10877064,A comparative study of the photosensitizing characteristics of some cyanine dyes.,"The present work has been carried out to explore the potential application of cyanines in photodynamic therapy. After photosensitization, the in vitro cytotoxic and antiproliferative activity on HeLa cells of a total of 35 cyanines belonging to several chemical subgroups is explored. Most of these cyanines have never been used before in similar experimental work. From a first set of experiments, it is found that none of the krypto-, oxa- and imidacyanines is photobiologically active on HeLa cells. Conversely, five thiacyanines (Thiacl-5), one rhodacyanine (Rhodac) and four indocyanines (Indoc2, Indoc4, Indoc5, Indoc7) show photodependent cytotoxicity or antiproliferative effects. A more detailed study shows that out of the ten selected compounds, eight cyanines feature significant photodependent cytotoxic and antiproliferative effects. All possess maximum absorption ranges between 545 and 824 nm. In particular, Rhodac, a tetramethinemeromonomethine rhodacyanine dye with an absorption maximum of 655 nm (ethanol) and a molar absorption coefficient epsilon = 108000 shows very promising photo-dependent biological activity. In general, the measured singlet oxygen quantum yield of the selected cyanines is low (< 0.08) and does not correlate with the degree of photosensitization. Furthermore, the present study shows that cyanines with a partition coefficient close to 1.5 accumulate to the highest extent in HeLa cells, while the more hydrophobic compounds (e.g., indocyanines) concentrate less intracellularly.",,,"Cell Survival, HeLa Cells, Humans, Indoles, Light, Models, Molecular, Molecular Conformation, Photosensitizing Agents, Structure-Activity Relationship",,

10824591,Cyanine dyes as protectors of K562 cells from photosensitized cell damage.,"Several cyanine dyes were found to protect K562 leukemia cells against toxicity mediated by cis-di(4-sulfonatophenyl)diphenylporphine (TPPS2) and light. Most cyanine dyes derived from dimethylindole were better photoprotectors than cyanine dyes with other structures. This correlated with the fact that cyanine dyes derived from dimethylindole were predominately monomeric at millimolar concentrations within K562 cells, while other cyanine dyes formed aggregates. For cyanine dyes that are derived from dimethylindole and have absorption band wavelengths greater than 700 nm, fluorescence-energy transfer from TPPS2 to the cyanine dye was the most important mechanism for photoprotection. There was no spectroscopic evidence for complex formation between the cyanine dyes and TPPS2. The dimethylindole derivative, 1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindodicarbocyanine, was an excellent photoprotector, but a poor quencher of TPPS2 fluorescence and a relatively poor singlet-oxygen quencher. This cyanine dye may act by quenching excited triplet TPPS2. Singlet-oxygen quenching may contribute to the photoprotection provided by cyanine dyes not derived from dimethylindole. Differences in the subcellular distribution of the various cyanine dyes studied may have contributed to the different apparent mechanisms of photoprotection.",,,"Cell Survival, Coloring Agents, Cyanides, Humans, K562 Cells, Light, Photosensitizing Agents, Porphyrins, Radiation-Protective Agents",,
10824585,Structural and environmental requirements for quenching of singlet oxygen by cyanine dyes.,"Singlet-oxygen quenching constants were measured for 19 cyanine dyes in acetonitrile. The most efficient quenchers were 1-butyl-2-[2-[3-[(1-butyl-6-chlorobenz-[cd]indol-2(1H)- ylidene)ethylidene]-2-chloro-1-cyclohexen-1-yl]ethenyl]-6-chlorobenz[cd] indolium and 6-chloro-2-[2-[3-(6-chloro-1-ethylbenz[cd]indol-2(1H)-ylidene) ethylidene]-2-phenyl-1-cyclopenten-1-yl]ethenyl]-1-ethyl-benz[cd]indolium, having quenching constants with diffusion-controlled values of 2.0 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) and 1.5 +/- 0.1 x 10(10) M-1 s-1, respectively. There was a trend toward increased quenching constants for cyanine dyes with the absorption band maxima at longer wavelengths. However, the quenching constants correlated better with the oxidation potentials of the cyanine dyes, suggesting that quenching proceeds by charge transfer rather than energy transfer. The quenching constants for 1,1',3,3,3',3'-hexamethylindotricarbocyanine perchlorate and 1,1'-diethyl-4,4'-carbocyanine iodide were measured in several solvents as well as in aqueous solutions of detergent micelles. In different solvents, the quenching constants varied by as much as a factor of 50. The quenching constants were largest in solvents with the highest values on the pi* scale of Kamlet, Abboud, Abraham and Taft. This was consistent with quenching occurring by charge transfer. Within cells, cyanine dyes concentrate in membrane-bound organelles. The quenching constants were substantial within detergent micelles. To the extent that micelles are models for biological membranes, cyanine dyes may be effective biological singlet-oxygen quenchers.",,,,,
10794454,Interaction of cyanine dyes with nucleic acids. XVII. Towards an aggregation of cyanine dyes in solutions as a factor facilitating nucleic acid detection.,"Spectral properties of newly synthesized cyanine dyes, namely 1-[6-(4-[6-[2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazol- 2-ylidenmethyl)-1-pyridiniumyl]hexanoyl]piperazino)-6- oxohexyl]-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazol+ ++-2-ylidenmethyl)pyridinium (K-6) (bichromophoric dye) and 1-[5-di(3-[5-[2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzothiazol++ +-2-ylidenmethyl)-1-pyridiniumyl]pentylcarboxamido]pro pyl) carbamoylpentyl]-2,6-dimethyl-4-(3-methyl-2,3-dihydro-1,3-benzo thiazol-2-ylidenmethyl) pyridinium (K-T) (trichromophoric dye) in solutions in the presence of and without deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were studied within a wide concentration range. It has been established that absorption, as well as fluorescence of investigated dye solutions, without DNA are mainly determined by H-aggregates of dye molecules. On the contrary, the fluorescence of dye solutions in the presence of DNA gives an intrinsic dye molecular fluorescence. H-aggregates are broken because of binding dye molecules with DNA. It has been suggested that both K-T and K-6 molecules bind mainly with DNA via the interaction of two chromophores. As the ratio of the number of dye molecules to that of DNA base pairs increases with an increase in dye concentration, a formation of dye molecule H-aggregates on DNA molecules are observed. Such aggregates have a different structure than those formed in the solutions without DNA. On the grounds of the data obtained, it is concluded that it is possible to use a dye aggregation capable of obtaining higher values for fluorescence enhancement of the DNA stains.",,,"Benzothiazoles, DNA, Fluorescent Dyes, Piperazines, Pyridines, Solutions, Thiazoles",,
24302383,Determination of the membrane potential of vacuoles isolated from red-beet storage tissue : Evidence for an electrogenic ATPase.,"The membrane potential of isolated vacuoles of red beet (Beta vulgaris L.) was estimated using several methods. The quenching of the fluorescence of the cyanine dyes 3,3'-diethylthiodicarbocyanine iodide (DiS-C2-(5)) and 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanine iodide (DiS-C3-(5)) in vacuoles indicated a transmembrane potential difference, negative inside at low external potassium concentrations. The Δψ was found to be-55 mV with two other methods, the distribution of (204)T1(+) in the presence of valinomycin and the distribution of the lipophilic cation triphenylmethylphosphonium. Uncouplers reduced this value to-35 mV. High external potassium concentrations, comparable to cytosolic values, abolished the membrane potential almost completely. The addition of 1 mM Tris-Mg(2+)-ATP markedly hyperpolarized the membrane to-75 mV. This effect was prevented by inhibitors of the ATPase activity located in isolated vacuole membranes.",,,,,
