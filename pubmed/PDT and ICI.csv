39704624,Combination of Bremachlorin PDT and immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-PD-1 shows response in murine immunological T-cell high and T-cell low PDAC models.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most challenging types of cancer with little or no response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to ablate tumors and induce an immune response. In our study, we investigated the effect of photodynamic therapy (PDT), using the photosensitizer Bremachlorin, in its ability to reduce tumor burden and to sensitize immunologically T-cell high and T-cell low murine PDAC tumors to the ICI that blocks programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint. In addition, we monitored the effect on survival and investigated if there was a response in PDT-treated and non PDT-treated distant tumors. Our results showed that Bremachlorin PDT induces direct tumor killing which increased survival in both 'hot' T-cell high and 'cold' T-cell low PDAC tumors and that it can make the T-cell high tumors more sensitive to ICI blocking PD-1. We found that T-cell high tumor bearing mice had an overall greater response to therapy than T-cell low tumor bearing mice. One mouse with T-cell high tumors exhibited complete tumor regression in both the treated and non-treated distant tumor 90 days after treatment. These results indicate that combining immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) with Bremachlorin PDT could be a promising therapeutic intervention for enhancing PDAC's response to therapy.",,,,,
39504926,Liposomal chlorin e6-mediated photodynamic therapy induces cell pyroptosis and promotes anti-tumor immune effects in breast cancer.,"Pyroptosis is a form of inflammatory cell death that has been demonstrated to trigger anti-tumor immune responses. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an innovative non-invasive treatment for tumors that effectively destroys tumor cells and boosts anti-tumor immune response. The ability of PDT to trigger pyroptosis and its mechanism of action are yet uncertain. In this study, we firstly verified that PDT effectively eliminates tumor cells. TEM and Western blot analysis demonstrated that tumor cells underwent pyroptosis following PDT therapy. Lipo-Ce6 mostly accumulates in the mitochondria of 4 T1 cells, and abundant ROS generated during PDT severely damage cell mitochondria, leading to the release of mitochondrial DNA, triggering the inflammasome caspase-1 signaling cascade, and ultimately causing cell pyroptosis, in addition NAC (a scavenger of ROS) and EB (a scavenger of mitochondrial DNA) can effectively prevent cell pyroptosis by PDT, which indicated the key role of ROS in PDT induced pyroptosis. Moreover, we also found PDT tiggered immunogenic cell death (ICD). Fourthermore, PDT can efficiently suppress tumor growth, trigger ICD and induce cell pyroptosis in mice. The introducing of immune checkpoint inhibitor BMS202 significantly boosts the tumor inhibition rate and promotes the infiltration of immune cells into the tumor. The body weight and HE. staining of normal organs primarily indicated the safety of this combined strategy. Our study demonstrated that PDT induced cell pyroptosis through mitochondrial oxidative damage and PDT induced pyroptosis effectively boost anti-cancer immunity, the combination of PDT and immune checkpoint inhibitor may be a promising clinical tumor treatment approaches.",,,"Pyroptosis, Photochemotherapy, Animals, Mice, Chlorophyllides, Breast Neoplasms, Porphyrins, Reactive Oxygen Species, Female, Cell Line, Tumor, Photosensitizing Agents, Mitochondria, Humans, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Inflammasomes, DNA, Mitochondrial",,
39238020,GSH-responsive polymeric micelles-based augmented photoimmunotherapy synergized with PD-1 blockade for eliciting robust antitumor immunity against colon tumor.,"Phototherapy is a promising antitumor modality, which consists of photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, the efficacy of phototherapy is dramatically hampered by local hypoxia in tumors, overexpression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumor cells. To address these issues, self-assembled multifunctional polymeric micelles (RIMNA) were developed to co-deliver photosensitizer indocyanine green (ICG), oxygenator MnO<sub>2</sub>, IDO inhibitor NLG919, and toll-like receptor 4 agonist monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA). It is worth noting that RIMNA polymeric micelles had good stability, uniform morphology, superior biocompatibility, and intensified PTT/PDT effect. What's more, RIMNA-mediated IDO inhibition combined with programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1)/PD-L1 blockade considerably improved immunosuppression and promoted immune activation. RIMNA-based photoimmunotherapy synergized with PD-1 antibody could remarkably inhibit primary tumor proliferation, as well as stimulate the immunity to greatly suppress lung metastasis and distant tumor growth. This study offers an efficient method to reinforce the efficacy of phototherapy and alleviate immunosuppression, thereby bringing clinical benefits to cancer treatment.",,,"Micelles, Animals, Colonic Neoplasms, Mice, Immunotherapy, Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor, Polymers, Cell Line, Tumor, Phototherapy, Indocyanine Green, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Photosensitizing Agents, Photochemotherapy, Female, Humans, B7-H1 Antigen, Lipid A",,
39137819,Functional co-delivery nanoliposomes based on improving hypoxia for increasing photoimmunotherapy efficacy of cold tumors.,"Cold tumors lack T cells infiltration and have low immunogenicity, resulting insufficient immunotherapy response. Therefore, how to realize the transformation from cold tumor to hot tumor is an urgent problem to be solved. Photodynamic therapy can induce immunogenic death of tumor cells (ICD) and activate T lymphocytes to produce tumor immune response. However, hypoxia in the cold tumor microenvironment limits the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy. So in this article, MET-HMME/CAT-HMME@Nlip as a functional co-delivery nanoliposomes was constructed based on overcoming the above problems. Firstly, the oxygen-deficient state could be improved by the following two ways, one is catalase loaded in CAT-HMME@Nlip can decompose high concentration hydrogen peroxide to produce oxygen, and the other is metformin loaded in MET-HMME@Nlip can decrease oxygen consumption by inhibiting of mitochondrial respiration. And then with the increase of substrate oxygen concentration, the sensitivity of photodynamic therapy can be greatly improved and the anti-tumor immune response by PDT-induced ICD can also be enhanced obviously. In addition, metformin could act as a small molecule immune checkpoint inhibitor to reduce the expression of PD-L1 on the surface of tumor cells, thereby effectively improving the specific killing ability of cytotoxic T cells to tumor cells which could not only erasing the primary tumor, but also inhibiting the growth of simulated distant tumors through the immune memory function. This study provides a new idea for improving the clinical treatment effect of hypoxic cold tumors, especially for tumors that could not benefit from immunotherapy due to low or no expression of PD-L1 protein on the surface of tumor cells.",,,"Liposomes, Photochemotherapy, Animals, Metformin, Immunotherapy, Tumor Microenvironment, Cell Line, Tumor, Nanoparticles, B7-H1 Antigen, Mice, Catalase, Humans, Neoplasms, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Female, Photosensitizing Agents, T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic, Tumor Hypoxia, Hydrogen Peroxide, Mice, Inbred BALB C",,
39113347,PDL1/HER2-Targeted Lipid-Encapsulated Oxygen Nanobubbles Combined with Photodynamic Therapy for HER2<sup>+</sup> Breast Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Programmed death (PD) 1/PD ligand 1 (PDL1) inhibitors are immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) that may facilitate HER2-positive breast cancer treatment; however, their clinical efficacy remains elusive. Oxygen-enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) increases immunogenic cell death (ICD), providing a promising strategy to render the tumor microenvironment more sensitive to the ICIs. Lipid-encapsulated oxygen nanobubbles (Lipo-NBs-O<sub>2</sub>) obtained using nanobubbles (NBs) water for oxygen delivery in vivo can facilitate enhanced PDT. Here, dual-receptor targeted Lipo-NBs-O<sub>2</sub> (DRT@Lipo-NBs-O<sub>2</sub>) is prepared by modifying Lipo-NBs-O<sub>2</sub> with anti-PDL1 scFv and the fusion protein anti-HER2 scFv-tandem-repeat cytochrome c (anti-HER2-nCytc). Copper phthalocyanine is the photosensitizer (PS). DRT@Lipo-PS-NBs-O<sub>2</sub> plus near-infrared irradiation leads to robust ICD induction, increasing DC activation and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell numbers. Modification with anti-PDL1 scFv improves tumor distribution of DRT@Lipo-PS-NBs-O<sub>2</sub> and plays the ICI role, invigorating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and boosting the effects of immunotherapy. Oxygen supplied through DRT@Lipo-PS-NBs-O<sub>2</sub> reduces P-glycoprotein expression. Enhanced PDT and Cytc can cause tumor cell death, thereby reducing the immune burden. Under dual receptor targeting and laser local irradiation, tumor cells become subject to the combination effects of PDT, ICD, ICIs, and apoptosis; this effectively suppresses tumor growth and metastasis. Lipo-NBs-O<sub>2</sub> affords a combination of oxygen delivery and multidrug therapy to alleviate HER2-positive breast cancer.",,,"Photochemotherapy, Animals, Receptor, ErbB-2, Female, Breast Neoplasms, B7-H1 Antigen, Immunotherapy, Mice, Oxygen, Lipids, Humans, Cell Line, Tumor, Photosensitizing Agents, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Nanoparticles",,
39091604,Research progress and future directions of immune checkpoint inhibitor combination therapy in advanced gastric cancer.,"In recent years, with the continuous development of molecular immunology, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have also been widely used in the treatment of gastric cancer, but they still face some challenges: The first is that only some people can benefit, the second is the treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) that occur during treatment, and the third is the emergence of varying degrees of drug resistance with long-term use. How to overcome these challenges, combined therapy based on ICIs has become one of the important strategies. This article summarizes the clinical application of ICIs combined with chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, thermotherapy, immune adjuvant, and dual immunotherapy and discusses the mechanism, and also summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of the current combination modalities and the potential research value. The aim of this study is to provide more and more optimized combination regimen for ICI combined therapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer and to provide reference for clinical and scientific research.",,,,,
38450765,Developing Hypoxia-Sensitive System via Designing Tumor-Targeted Fullerene-Based Photosensitizer for Multimodal Therapy of Deep Tumor.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been approved for clinic. However, powerless efficiency for deep hypoxic tumor therapy remains an enormous challenge for PDT. Herein, a hypoxia-sensitive nanotherapeutic system (FTCD-SRGD) based on fullerene (C<sub>70</sub>) and anoxic activating chemical prodrug tirapazamine (TPZ) is rationally designed for multimodal therapy of deep hypoxic tumors. To enhance the accumulation and achieve specific drug release in tumor, the FTCD-SRGD is modified with cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (cRGDfK) peptide and disulfide bonds. With the exacerbated hypoxic microenvironment created by C<sub>70</sub> consuming O<sub>2</sub> for generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), TPZ is activated to produce toxic radical species to ablate deep tumors, which achieves a synergistic treatment of C<sub>70</sub>-mediated PDT and hypoxia-enhanced chemotherapy. Additionally, given this hypoxia-sensitive system-induced immunogenic cell death (ICD) activating anticancer cytotoxic T lymphocyte to result in more susceptible tumor to immunotherapy, FTCD-SRGD plus immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-L1) fully inhibit deep hypoxic tumors by promoting infiltration of effector T cells in tumors. Collectively, it is the first time to develop a multimodal therapy system with fullerene-based hypoxia-sensitive PS for deep tumors. The powerful multimodal nanotherapeutic system for combining hypoxia-enhanced PDT and immunotherapy to massacre deep hypoxic tumors can provide a paradigm to combat the present bottleneck of tumor therapy.",,,"Fullerenes, Photosensitizing Agents, Animals, Photochemotherapy, Mice, Cell Line, Tumor, Tirapazamine, Humans, Combined Modality Therapy, Tumor Microenvironment, Reactive Oxygen Species, Neoplasms, Tumor Hypoxia, Prodrugs, Antineoplastic Agents",,
37595669,Alum-tuned hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel with immune checkpoint inhibition for immunophoto therapy of cancer.,"Alum-crosslinked hyaluronic acid-dopamine (HD) hydrogel containing indocyanine green (ICG) with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) antibody (Ab) administration was developed for immunophoto therapy of cancer. Alum modulates the rheological characteristics of hydrogel for enabling syringe injection, shear-thinning feature, and slower biodegradation. In addition, alum in HD-based hydrogel provided CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-mediated immune responses for cancer therapy. ICG in the hydrogel under near-infrared (NIR) light exposure may induce hyperthermia and generate singlet oxygen for selective cancer cell killing. HD/alum/ICG hydrogel injection with NIR laser irradiation elevated PD-1 level in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Administration of PD-1 Ab aiming at highly expressed PD-1 in T cells may amplify the anticancer efficacies of HD/alum/ICG hydrogel along with NIR laser. HD/alum/ICG hydrogel with NIR light may have both CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-linked immune responses and ICG-related photodynamic/photothermal effects. Additional injection of immune checkpoint inhibitor can ultimately suppress primary and distant tumor growth by combination with those therapeutic actions.",,,,,
37503901,Engineering Au<sub>44</sub> Nanoclusters for NIR-II Luminescence Imaging-Guided Photoactivatable Cancer Immunotherapy.,"Immunotherapy is an advanced therapeutic strategy of cancer treatment but suffers from the issues of off-target adverse effects, lack of real-time monitoring techniques, and unsustainable response. Herein, an ultrasmall Au nanocluster (NC)-based theranostic probe is designed for second near-infrared window (NIR-II) photoluminescence (PL) imaging-guided phototherapies and photoactivatable cancer immunotherapy. The probe (Au<sub>44</sub>MBA<sub>26</sub>-NLG for short) is composed of atomically precise and NIR-II emitting Au<sub>44</sub>MBA<sub>26</sub> NCs (here MBA denotes water-soluble 4-mercaptobenzoic acid) conjugated with immune checkpoint inhibitor 1-cyclohexyl-2-(5H-imidazo[5,1-<i>a</i>]isoindol-5-yl)ethanol (NLG919) via a singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>)-cleavable linker. Upon NIR photoirradiation, the Au<sub>44</sub>MBA<sub>26</sub>-NLG not only enables NIR-II PL imaging of tumors in deep tissues for guiding tumor therapy but also allows the leverage of photothermal property for cancer photothermal therapy (PTT) and the photogenerated <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> for photodynamic therapy (PDT) and releasing NLG919 for cancer immunotherapy. Such a multiple effect modulated by Au<sub>44</sub>MBA<sub>26</sub>-NLG prompts the proliferation and activation of effector T cells, upshifts systemic antitumor T-lymphocyte (T cell) immunity, and finally suppresses the growth of both primary and distant tumors in living mice. Overall, this study may provide a promising theranostic nanoplatform toward NIR-II PL imaging-guided phototherapies and photoactivatable cancer immunotherapy.",,,"Animals, Mice, Luminescence, Cell Line, Tumor, Photochemotherapy, Phototherapy, Neoplasms, Immunotherapy, Theranostic Nanomedicine, Nanoparticles",,
37219321,Multi-shell structured upconversion nanocarriers that combine IDO inhibitor-induced immunotherapy with NIR-triggered photodynamic therapy for deep tumors.,"Combination therapies for cancer have attracted substantial research interest as an emerging treatment strategy that can reduce the chance of cancer resistance to chemotherapy and deal effectively with cancer cell heterogeneity. In this study, we designed novel nanocarriers that combine immunotherapy, which attacks tumors by stimulating the immune system, with photodynamic therapy (PDT), a non-invasive phototherapy that can selectively destroy only cancer cells. Multi-shell structured upconversion nanoparticles (MSUCNs) with good photoluminescence (PL) strength were synthesized for a combination therapy of near-infrared (NIR) light-induced PDT and immunotherapy using a specific immune checkpoint inhibitor. By optimizing the doping content of ytterbium ions (Yb<sup>3+</sup>) and forming a multi-shell structure, MSUCNs able to emit light at multiple wavelengths with the PL efficiency improved by 260-380 times compared to core particles were synthesized. Then, the surfaces of the MSUCNs were modified with folic acid (FA) as a tumor-targeting ligand, Ce6 as a photosensitizer (PS), and 1-methyl-tryptophan (1MT) as an indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) inhibitor. The FA-, Ce6-, and 1MT-conjugated MSUCNs (F-MSUCN3-Ce6/1MT) exhibited targeted cellular uptake by active targeting against HeLa cells, which are FA receptor-positive cancer cells. Upon irradiation with NIR at 808 nm, the F-MSUCN3-Ce6/1MT nanocarriers produced reactive oxygen species, which caused apoptosis of the cancer cells, and activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, which enhanced the immune response by binding with immune checkpoint inhibitory proteins and blocking the IDO pathway. Therefore, these F-MSUCN3-Ce6/1MT nanocarriers could be potential candidate materials for synergistic anticancer therapy that combines IDO inhibitor-based immunotherapy with enhanced NIR-triggered PDT.",,,"Humans, Photochemotherapy, HeLa Cells, Cell Line, Tumor, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Photosensitizing Agents, Nanoparticles, Immunologic Factors, Enzyme Inhibitors, Immunotherapy",,
37151267,Emerging Treatments for Reactive Cutaneous Capillary Endothelial Proliferation.,"Reactive cutaneous capillary endothelial proliferation (RCCEP) is a common, burdensome adverse event that occurs in up to 88% of patients treated with camrelizumab. Without treatment, RCCEP is associated with social stigma and low quality of life. However, the optimal management of RCCEP remains inconclusive. to elucidate the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of RCCEP and systematically review the existing different therapeutic options for this dermatologic toxicity to encourage the selection of the most appropriate approaches for individual comprehensive management. As far as we know, we have systematically reviewed all cases complicated with RCCEP worldwide, and summarized the advantages and disadvantages of existing treatment methods. In addition, we report a successful case of 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) in a 61-year-old male Chinese patient who developed RCCEP after camrelizumab immunotherapy. Owing to the patient's advanced age, complicated medication history, and hyperalgesia, ALA-PDT was performed. The multiple lesions on his chest and buttocks showed rapid relief within 1 week of a single treatment session. Clinical recurrence was not observed within 6 months following treatment. The current treatment of RCCEP is challenging and there is a lack of globally recommendations based on strict therapeutic regimens or clinical trials. Based on this case, we found that ALA-PDT is a safe and effective treatment option for RCCEP. This case also highlights the coexistence of several camrelizumab-induced dermatologic immune-related adverse events, which has never been reported before. New therapies for RCCEP have emerged in recent years. Dermatologists should raise better awareness of the complexity of drug eruption and the need for early diagnosis and medical intervention.",,,,,
36778024,Photodynamic therapy in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy for first-line treatment in advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer: A phase 2-3 clinical trial protocol.,"<b>Introduction:</b> The immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) has been approved as the first-line therapy for metastatic gastric cancer in China. The treatment response of immune checkpoint inhibitor is highly dependent on the immune condition within the tumor microenvironment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has a long history in cancer treatment, and recent studies showed it had an immunomodulatory effect on the tumor. Here we will conduct a trial to assess whether or not a combination with Photodynamic therapy will improve the outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitor-based treatment in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric cancer. <b>Methods:</b> This study is a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled, phase 2-3 trial. Patients (18-65 years old) with untreated gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma will be eligible for this trial. Sixty participants will be enrolled and randomly divided into the test group (<i>n</i> = 30) and control group (<i>n</i> = 30) to receive photodynamic therapy in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitor plus chemotherapy, respectively. The primary is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary outcomes include objective response rates (ORRs) and the occurrence of adverse events. In addition, we will also assess the changes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and tumor microenvironment after photodynamic therapy treatment in the test group. Evaluation of the tumor response will be performed every two cycles for a maximum of eight cycles. <b>Discussion:</b> Photodynamic therapy has an immunomodulatory effect on the tumor microenvironment; however, this has not been demonstrated for gastric cancer in a clinical trial. Based on our experience of photodynamic therapy treatment in digestive tract tumors, we plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial on this topic. This will be the first study to evaluate the synergistic effect of photodynamic therapy with immunochemotherapy for patients with advanced gastric cancer. <b>Ethics and dissemination:</b> It was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee of Lanzhou University Second Hospital (No. 2022A-491). When this trial is completed, it will be shared at conferences and submitted for a potential publication in a peer-reviewed journal. <b>Clinical Trial Registration:</b> http://www.chictr.org.cn/, identifier ChiCTR2200064280.",,,,,
36726602,Anti-tumor immunity enhancement by photodynamic therapy with talaporfin sodium and anti-programmed death 1 antibody.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a relatively non-invasive anti-cancer therapy that employs a photosensitizer with a specific wavelength of light irradiation. PDT induces direct cell killing and enhancement effects on tumor immunity, but its underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we perform a basic analysis of the anti-tumor effect of talaporfin sodium (TS)-PDT as well as its synergism with the immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-programmed death 1 (anti-PD-1) antibody. We estimate the cell death mechanism induced by TS-PDT and the induction of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by TS-PDT <i>in vitro</i>. We establish a syngeneic mouse model of bilateral flank tumors and verify the enhancement of the abscopal effect on the non-irradiated side. TS-PDT induced apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy-associated cell death <i>in vitro</i>. TS-PDT induced the release and/or expression of DAMPs <i>in vitro</i>. Tumor growth was inhibited in the TS-PDT and anti-PD-1 antibody combination group compared with other single-treatment or non-treatment groups <i>in vivo</i>. In summary, TS-PDT induces the release and/or expression of DAMPs, indicating that it activates innate immunity. PD-1 blockage enhances the anti-tumor immunity induced by TS-PDT. Thus, our results demonstrate that the combination of TS-PDT and anti-PD-1 antibody can potentially be used for anti-tumor therapy.",,,,,
36442438,Repeated photodynamic therapy mediates the abscopal effect through multiple innate and adaptive immune responses with and without immune checkpoint therapy.,"In combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, photodynamic therapy can induce robust immune responses capable of preventing local tumor recurrence and delaying the growth of distant, untreated disease (ie. the abscopal effect). Previously, we found that repeated photodynamic therapy (R-PDT) using porphyrin lipoprotein (PLP) as a photosensitizer, without the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor, can induce the abscopal effect. To understand why PLP mediated R-PDT alone can induce the abscopal effect, and how the addition of an immune checkpoint inhibitor can further strengthen the abscopal effect, we investigated the broader immune mechanisms facilitated by R-PDT and combination R-PDT + anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (αPD-1) in a highly aggressive, subcutaneous AE17-OVA mesothelioma dual tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. We found a 46.64-fold and 61.33-fold increase in interleukin-6 (IL-6) after R-PDT and combination R-PDT + αPD-1 relative to PBS respectively, suggesting broad innate immune activation. There was a greater propensity for antigen presentation in the spleen and distal, non-irradiated tumor draining lymph nodes, as dendritic cells and macrophages had increased expression of MHC class II, CD80, and CD86, after R-PDT and combination R-PDT + αPD-1. Concurrently, there was a shift in the proportions of CD4+ T cell subsets in the spleen, and an increase in the frequency of CD8+ T cells in the distal, non-irradiated tumor draining lymph nodes. While R-PDT had an acceptable safety profile, combination R-PDT + αPD-1 induced 1.26-fold higher serum potassium and 1.33-fold phosphorus, suggestive of mild laboratory tumor lysis syndrome. Histology revealed an absence of gross inflammation in critical organs after R-PDT and combination R-PDT + αPD-1 relative to PBS-treated mice. Taken together, our findings shed light on how the abscopal effect can be induced by PDT and strengthened by combination R-PDT + αPD-1, and suggests minimal toxicities after R-PDT.",,,"Mice, Animals, Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Cell Line, Tumor, Photochemotherapy, Porphyrins, Immunity",,
36377488,Tumor Cell-Responsive Photodynamic Immunoagent for Immunogenicity-Enhanced Orthotopic and Remote Tumor Therapy.,"Combining photodynamic therapy (PDT) and immune checkpoint blockades is an efficient method to maximize immunotherapeutic outcome by boosting tumor immunogenicity and modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. However, the always-on bioactivity of photosensitizers or immune checkpoint inhibitors leads to uncontrollable side effects, limiting the in vivo therapeutic efficacy of treatments. An activatable strategy is of great importance for improving the selectivity during cancer therapy. In this study, a photodynamic immunomodulator, ICy-NLG, is developed by conjugating the photosensitizer ICy-NH2 with the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 inhibitor NLG919 through a glutathione (GSH)-cleavable linker to achieve activatable photodynamic immunotherapy. The conjugation considerably suppresses both the PDT effect and the activity of the inhibitor. After ICy-NLG is activated by high levels of GSH in tumor cells, the PDT effect is restored and leads to immunogenic tumor cell death. The released tumor-associated antigens in conjunction with the activated immune checkpoint inhibitor induce a synergistic antitumor immune response, resulting in the growth inhibition of primary and distant tumors and the prevention of lung metastasis in mouse xenograft models.",,,"Animals, Mice, Humans, Photochemotherapy, Cell Line, Tumor, Photosensitizing Agents, Immunotherapy, Lung Neoplasms, Tumor Microenvironment, Nanoparticles",,
35631600,Heptamethine Cyanine-Loaded Nanomaterials for Cancer Immuno-Photothermal/Photodynamic Therapy: A Review.,"The development of strategies capable of eliminating metastasized cancer cells and preventing tumor recurrence is an exciting and extremely important area of research. In this regard, therapeutic approaches that explore the synergies between nanomaterial-mediated phototherapies and immunostimulants/immune checkpoint inhibitors have been yielding remarkable results in pre-clinical cancer models. These nanomaterials can accumulate in tumors and trigger, after irradiation of the primary tumor with near infrared light, a localized temperature increase and/or reactive oxygen species. These effects caused damage in cancer cells at the primary site and can also (i) relieve tumor hypoxia, (ii) release tumor-associated antigens and danger-associated molecular patterns, and (iii) induced a pro-inflammatory response. Such events will then synergize with the activity of immunostimulants and immune checkpoint inhibitors, paving the way for strong T cell responses against metastasized cancer cells and the creation of immune memory. Among the different nanomaterials aimed for cancer immuno-phototherapy, those incorporating near infrared-absorbing heptamethine cyanines (Indocyanine Green, IR775, IR780, IR797, IR820) have been showing promising results due to their multifunctionality, safety, and straightforward formulation. In this review, combined approaches based on phototherapies mediated by heptamethine cyanine-loaded nanomaterials and immunostimulants/immune checkpoint inhibitor actions are analyzed, focusing on their ability to modulate the action of the different immune system cells, eliminate metastasized cancer cells, and prevent tumor recurrence.",,,,,
35611682,Synthetic and Biodegradable Molybdenum(IV) Diselenide Triggers the Cascade Photo- and Immunotherapy of Tumor.,"In this study, a polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-decorated MoSe<sub>2</sub> (MoSe<sub>2</sub> -PVP) nanoparticle with excellent photothermal transforming ability and chlorin E6 (Ce6) loading capacity is designed for combined tumor photothermal therapy (PTT), tumor photodynamic therapy (PDT), and immunotherapy. The light-to-heat conversion efficiency under irradiation with an 808 nm near-infrared laser is as high as 59.28%. The MoSe<sub>2</sub> -PVP NPs could function as an artificial catalase and catalyze the decomposition of H<sub>2</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . Their catalytic activity and thermal durability are higher than the native catalase, which relieve the tumor hypoxia status and sensitize the tumor PDT. The data show that the synthetic MoSe<sub>2</sub> -PVP is biodegradable, owing to the oxidation of the Mo<sup>4+</sup> to Mo<sup>6+</sup> . Moreover, its degradation products could increase the proportion of mature dendritic cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> thymus (T) cells and promote the infiltration of active CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in tumors. The immune checkpoint inhibitor, programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal antibody is combined with MoSe<sub>2</sub> -PVP and it is found that its degradation product could efficiently change the immune microenvironment of the tumor.",,,"CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Catalase, Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Immunotherapy, Molybdenum, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Porphyrins, Tumor Microenvironment",,
35580813,Light-triggered photodynamic nanomedicines for overcoming localized therapeutic efficacy in cancer treatment.,"Photodynamic nanomedicines have significantly enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of photosensitizers (PSs) by overcoming critical limitations of PSs such as poor water solubility and low tumor accumulation. Furthermore, functional photodynamic nanomedicines have enabled overcoming oxygen depletion during photodynamic therapy (PDT) and tissue light penetration limitation by supplying oxygen or upconverting light in targeted tumor tissues, resulting in providing the potential to overcome biological therapeutic barriers of PDT. Nevertheless, their localized therapeutic effects still remain a huddle for the effective treatment of metastatic- or recurrent tumors. Recently, newly designed photodynamic nanomedicines and their combination chemo- or immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy enable the systemic treatment of various metastatic tumors by eliciting antitumor immune responses via immunogenic cell death (ICD). This review introduces recent advances in photodynamic nanomedicines and their applications, focusing on overcoming current limitations.

35487065,A peptide-AIEgen nanocomposite mediated whole cancer immunity cycle-cascade amplification for improved immunotherapy of tumor.,"Immunotherapy maintains the cancer-immunity cycle via re-activating the immune system, so as to achieve the purpose of anti-tumor. However, the response rate of current tumor immunotherapy strategies is still low. Even the most reported immune checkpoint block (ICB), the objective response rate (ORR) is only about 10-30%. Here, aiming at obtaining a higher response rate, we designed a cascade amplification nanocomposite consisting of the immune adjuvant polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [Poly (I:C)] and aggregation-induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)-modified modular peptide (named PMRA). The PMRA includes: <sup>D</sup>PPA-1 peptide (P), an immune checkpoint inhibitor; PLGLAG peptide (M), a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) responsive sequence to promote the release of <sup>D</sup>PPA-1; RRRRRRRR peptide (R), for loading the Poly (I:C); PyTPA (A), a photosensitizer with AIE property. In cancer-immunity cycle, photodynamic therapy (PDT) mediated by PyTPA promotes the release of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and primes T lymphocytes. The cytokines coming from the stimulation of PDT and Poly (I:C) promote the activation of T lymphocytes. The high level of chemokines in tumor microenvironment promotes immune cells migration and infiltration in tumor with the assistance of PDT. Finally, through ICB with <sup>D</sup>PPA-1 peptide, T lymphocytes enhance the recognition of tumor cells and killing tumor cells. Immunogenic cell death induces the release of more TAAs, which will enter the next cycle and complete the full-loop again. Taking advantages of whole cancer-immunity cycle, the cascade amplification nanocomposite achieved almost 100% ORR in vivo. This concept of whole cancer-immunity cycle enhanced immunotherapy provides a novel perspective for tumor treatment.",,,"Antigens, Neoplasm, Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Immunotherapy, Matrix Metalloproteinase 2, Nanocomposites, Neoplasms, Peptides, Photochemotherapy, Tumor Microenvironment",,
34864195,Photodynamic therapy combined with immunotherapy for an advanced esophageal cancer with an obstruction post metal stent implantation: A case report and literature review.,"Surgery is the main treatment for resectable esophageal cancer but not for advanced esophageal cancer with distant metastasis. PDT is a therapeutic strategy for dysphagia and select unresectable esophageal cancer, with tremendous advantages of minimal invasiveness and organ-preserving treatment modality. PDT prevents tumor progression and growth by inducing vascular injury and local acute inflammatory responses. Immunotherapy, combined with PDT, may contribute to the efficacy of PDT in the treatment of esophageal cancer and reduce the probability of tumor recurrence. A 54-year-old male patient with advanced esophageal cancer was hospitalized in the author's hospital on 20th April 2020, who had been treated with two cycles of chemotherapy at the local hospital but failed. In this case, after metal stent implantation, the patient underwent a remarkable and successful treatment of PDT combined with sintilimab, a PD-1 inhibitor. An additional immune checkpoint inhibitor and chemotherapy offer the opportunity to eliminate residual and invisible tumors. The patient had an excellent prognosis that not only the primary lesion was cured, but also the metastatic lymph nodes were significantly reduced, with no tumor recurrence in the last endoscopic review. PDT in combination with immunotherapy is a promising strategy to eliminate primary and metastatic esophageal cancer by generating local and systemic antitumor responses, especially after interventional esophageal stent implantation for relief of obstruction.",,,"Esophageal Neoplasms, Humans, Immunotherapy, Male, Middle Aged, Neoplasm Recurrence, Local, Photochemotherapy, Stents",,
34834202,Antitumor Immune Response Triggered by Metal-Based Photosensitizers for Photodynamic Therapy: Where Are We?,"Metal complexes based on transition metals have rich photochemical and photophysical properties that are derived from a variety of excited state electronic configurations triggered by visible and near-infrared light. These properties can be exploited to produce powerful energy and electron transfer processes that can lead to oxygen-(in)dependent photobiological activity. These principles are the basis of photodynamic therapy (PDT), which is a clinically approved treatment that offers a promising, effective, and noninvasive complementary treatment or even an alternative to treat several types of cancers. PDT is based on a reaction involving a photosensitizer (PS), light, and oxygen, which ultimately generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, skin photosensitivity, due to the accumulation of PSs in skin cells, has hampered, among other elements, its clinical development and application. Therefore, these is an increasing interest in the use of (metal-based) PSs that are more specific to tumor cells. This may increase efficacy and corollary decrease side-effects. To this end, metal-containing nanoparticles with photosensitizing properties have recently been developed. In addition, several studies have reported that the use of immunogenic/immunomodulatory metal-based nanoparticles increases the antitumor efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy mediated by anti-PD-(L)1 or CTLA-4 antibodies. In this review, we discuss the main metal complexes used as PDT PSs. Lastly, we review the preclinical studies associated with metal-based PDT PSs and immunotherapies. This therapeutic association could stimulate PDT.",,,,,
33819816,A near infrared ratiometric platform based π-extended porphyrin metal-organic framework for O<sub>2</sub> imaging and cancer therapy.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is widely researched in tumor treatment, but its therapeutic effect is affected by oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentration of tumor site. Here, we developed a Pd-coordinated π-conjugated extended porphyrin doped porphyrin metal-organic-framework (named as PTP). PTP can achieve near infrared (NIR) O<sub>2</sub> concentration ratiometric imaging, solving the problems of short detection wavelengths and influence of self-concentrations. With the NIR excitation wavelength and the ability of higher singlet oxygen (<sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub>) generation, PTP can induce PDT more effectively. The efficient PDT also mediates cancer immunogenic cell death (ICD), which combines with the immune checkpoint inhibitor αPD-1 to achieve obviously cancer suppression and anti-metastasis effect. This theranostic NIR ratiometric nanoprobe can be used as a pre-evaluation on the outcome of PDT and high-efficient cancer combined treatment system, which will find great potential in tumor diagnosis and treatment.",,,"Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Metal-Organic Frameworks, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms, Oxygen, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Porphyrins",,
33171765,Combination of Photodynamic Therapy and a Flagellin-Adjuvanted Cancer Vaccine Potentiated the Anti-PD-1-Mediated Melanoma Suppression.,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors become a standard therapy for malignant melanoma. As immune checkpoint inhibitor monotherapies proved to have limited efficacy in significant portion of patients, it is envisaged that combination with other therapeutic modalities may improve clinical outcomes. We investigated the effect of combining photodynamic therapy (PDT) and TLR5 agonist flagellin-adjuvanted tumor-specific peptide vaccination (FlaB-Vax) on the promotion of PD-1 blockade-mediated melanoma suppression using a mouse B16-F10 implantation model. Using a bilateral mouse melanoma cancer model, we evaluated the potentiation of PD-1 blockade by the combination of peritumoral FlaB-Vax delivery and PDT tumor ablation. A photosensitizing agent, pheophorbide A (PhA), was used for laser-triggered photodynamic destruction of the primary tumor. The effect of combination therapy in conjunction with PD-1 blockade was evaluated for tumor growth and survival. The effector cytokines that promote the activation of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and antigen-presenting cells in tumor tissue and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) were also assayed. PDT and FlaB-Vax combination therapy induced efficacious systemic antitumor immune responses for local and abscopal tumor control, with a significant increase in tumor-infiltrating effector memory CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and systemic IFNγ secretion. The combination of PDT and FlaB-Vax also enhanced the infiltration of tumor antigen-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and the accumulation of migratory CXCL10-secreting CD103<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) presumably contributing to tumor antigen cross-presentation in the tumor microenvironment (TME). The CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell-dependent therapeutic benefits of PDT combined with FlaB-Vax was significantly enhanced by a PD-1-targeting checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Conclusively, the combination of FlaB-Vax with PDT-mediated tumor ablation would serve a safe and feasible combinatorial therapy for enhancing PD-1 blockade treatment of malignant melanoma.",,,"Adjuvants, Immunologic, Animals, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Cancer Vaccines, Cell Line, Tumor, Cell Proliferation, Chlorophyll, Combined Modality Therapy, Cross-Priming, Flagellin, Humans, Immunologic Memory, Interferon-gamma, Liposomes, Melanoma, Experimental, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Nanoparticles, Photochemotherapy, Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor",,
32387551,Construction of microneedle-assisted co-delivery platform and its combining photodynamic/immunotherapy.,"Despite advances in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for treating superficial tumor, the prospect of this monotherapy remains challenges in the context of systemic phototoxicity and poor efficacy. In this work, a physiologically self-degradable microneedle (MN)-assisted platform is developed for combining PDT and immunotherapy via controlled co-delivery of photosensitizer (PS) and checkpoint inhibitor anti-CTLA4 antibody (aCTLA4), which generates synergistic reinforcement outcome while reducing side effects. MN is composed of biocompatible hyaluronic acid integrated with the pH-sensitive dextran nanoparticles, which is fabricated to simultaneously encapsulate hydrophobic (Zinc Phthalocyanine) and hydrophilic agents (aCTLA4) via a double emulsion method. This co-loading carrier can aggregate effectively around topical tumor by microneedle-assisted transdermal delivery. In vivo studies using 4T1 mouse models, PDT firstly exerts its effect to killing tumor and triggers the immune responses, subsequently, facilitating the immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitor (aCTLA4). The possible mechanism and systemic effects of the combined therapy are investigated, which demonstrate that this co-administration platform can be a promising tool for focal cancer treatment.",,,"Animals, Cell Line, Tumor, Immunotherapy, Mice, Nanoparticles, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents",,
32372095,Low-dose photodynamic therapy promotes a cytotoxic immunological response in a murine model of pleural mesothelioma.,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a deadly disease with limited treatment options. Approaches to enhance patient immunity against MPM have been tested but shown variable results. Previously, we have demonstrated interesting vascular modulating properties of low-dose photodynamic therapy (L-PDT) on MPM. Here, we hypothesized that L-PDT vascular modulation could favour immune cell extravasation in MPM and improve tumour control in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors. First, we assessed the impact of L-PDT on vascular endothelial E-selectin expression, a key molecule for immune cell extravasation, in vitro and in a syngeneic murine model of MPM. Second, we characterized the tumour immune cell infiltrate by 15-colour flow cytometry analysis 2 and 7 days after L-PDT treatment of the murine MPM model. Third, we determined how L-PDT combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-CTLA4 affected tumour growth in a murine MPM model. L-PDT significantly enhanced E-selectin expression by endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. This correlated with increased CD8+ T cells and activated antigen-presenting cells (CD11b+ dendritic cells and macrophages) infiltration in MPM. Also, compared to anti-CTLA4 that only affects tumour growth, the combination of L-PDT with anti-CTLA4 caused complete MPM regression in 37.5% of animals. L-PDT enhances E-selectin expression in the MPM endothelium, which favours immune infiltration of tumours. The combination of L-PDT with immune checkpoint inhibitor anti-CTLA4 allows best tumour control and regression.",,,"Animals, Cell Line, Tumor, Disease Models, Animal, Endothelial Cells, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Mesothelioma, Mice, Photochemotherapy, Pleural Neoplasms",,
31397999,High Affinity of Chlorin e6 to Immunoglobulin G for Intraoperative Fluorescence Image-Guided Cancer Photodynamic and Checkpoint Blockade Therapy.,"Cancer photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents an attractive local treatment in combination with immunotherapy. Successful cancer PDT relies on image guidance to ensure the treatment accuracy. However, existing nanotechnology for co-delivery of photosensitizers and image contrast agents slows the clearance of PDT agents from the body and causes a disparity between the release profiles of the imaging and PDT agents. We have found that the photosensitizer Chlorin e6 (Ce6) is inherently bound to immunoglobulin G (IgG) in a nanomolarity range of affinity. Ce6 and IgG self-assemble to form the nanocomplexes termed Chloringlobulin (<b>Chlorin</b> e6 + immuno<b>globulin</b> G). Chloringlobulin enhances the Ce6 concentration in the tumor without changing its elimination half-life in blood. Utilizing the immune checkpoint inhibitor antiprogrammed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) (αPD-L1) to prepare αPD-L1 Chloringlobulin, we have demonstrated a combination of Ce6-based red-light fluorescence image-guided surgery, stereotactic PDT, and PD-L1 blockade therapy of mice bearing orthotopic glioma. In mice bearing an orthotopic colon cancer model, we have prepared another Chloringlobulin that allows intraoperative fluorescence image-guided PDT in combination with PD-L1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) dual checkpoint blockade therapy. The Chloringlobulin technology shows great potential for clinical translation of combinatorial intraoperative fluorescence image-guided PDT and checkpoint blockade therapy.",,,"Animals, B7-H1 Antigen, CTLA-4 Antigen, Cell Line, Tumor, Chlorophyllides, Female, Fluorescence, Immunoglobulin G, Immunotherapy, Intraoperative Care, Male, Mice, Inbred BALB C, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Porphyrins, Rats, Tissue Distribution",,
30627091,Treatment of Head and Neck Cancer with Photodynamic Therapy with Redaporfin: A Clinical Case Report.,"Advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, after locoregional treatment and multiple lines of systemic therapies, represents a great challenge to overcome acquired resistance. The present clinical case illustrates a successful treatment option and is the first to describe the use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with Redaporfin, followed by immune checkpoint inhibition with an anti-PD1 antibody. This patient presented an extensive tumor in the mouth pavement progressing after surgery, radiotherapy, and multiple lines of systemic treatment. PDT with Redaporfin achieved the destruction of all visible tumor, and the sequential use of an immune checkpoint inhibitor allowed a sustained complete response. This case is an example of the effect of this therapeutic combination and may provide the basis for a new treatment modality.",,,,,
29981170,Nanoparticle-based photothermal and photodynamic immunotherapy for tumor treatment.,"Nanoparticle-based phototherapies, such as photothermal therapy (PTT) and photodynamic therapy (PDT), exhibit strong efficacy, minimal invasion and negligible side effects in tumor treatment. These phototherapies have received considerable attention and been extensively studied in recent years. In addition to directly killing tumor cells through heat and reactive oxygen species, PTT and PDT can also induce various antitumor effects. In particular, the resultant massive tumor cell death after PTT and PDT triggers immune responses, including the redistribution and activation of immune effector cells, the expression and secretion of cytokines and the transformation of memory T lymphocytes. The antitumor effects can be enhanced by immune checkpoint blockage therapy. This article reviewed the recent advances of nanoparticle-based PTT and PDT, summarized the studies on nanoparticle-based photothermal and photodynamic immunotherapies in vitro and in vivo, and discussed challenges and future research directions.",,,"B7-H1 Antigen, CTLA-4 Antigen, Cytokines, Heat-Shock Proteins, Humans, Hyperthermia, Induced, Immunologic Memory, Immunotherapy, Nanoparticles, Neoplasms, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, T-Lymphocytes",,
29420012,Enhanced Immunotherapy Based on Photodynamic Therapy for Both Primary and Lung Metastasis Tumor Eradication.,"Metastasis and recurrence are two unavoidable and intractable problems in cancer therapy, despite various robust therapeutic approaches. Currently, it seems that immunotherapy is an effective approach to solve these problems, but the high heterogeneity of tumor tissue, inefficient presentation of tumor antigen, and deficient targeting ability of therapy usually blunt the efficacy of immunotherapy and hinder its clinical application. Herein, an approach based on combining photodynamic and immunological therapy was designed and developed. We synthesized a chimeric peptide, PpIX-1MT, which integrates photosensitizer PpIX with immune checkpoint inhibitor 1MT via a caspase-responsive peptide sequence, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp (DEVD), to realize a cascaded synergistic effect. The PpIX-1MT peptide could form nanoparticles in PBS and accumulate in tumor areas via the enhanced penetration retention effect. Upon 630 nm light irradiation, the PpIX-1MT nanoparticles produced reactive oxygen species, induced apoptosis of cancer cells, and thus facilitated the expression of caspase-3 and the production of tumor antigens, which could trigger an intense immune response. The subsequently released 1MT upon caspase-3 cleavage could further strengthen the immune system and help to activate CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells effectively. This cascaded synergistic effect could inhibit both primary and lung metastasis tumor effectively, which may provide the solution for solving tumor recurrence and metastasis clinically.",,,"Animals, Antigens, Neoplasm, Apoptosis, CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes, Cell Line, Tumor, Humans, Immunologic Factors, Immunotherapy, Lung Neoplasms, Mice, Nanoparticles, Peptides, Photochemotherapy, Photosensitizing Agents, Protoporphyrins",,
